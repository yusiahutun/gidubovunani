But now, she’s adding a new title to her resume: the designer of your favorite loungewear. Chabert recently <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>released a collection</a> of sleep sets, pullovers, leggings, and throw-on-and-go dresses with HSN, and when speaking with InStyle, shares that designing has always been on her bucket list.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I've always dreamed of having a clothing line,” she tells us. “Growing up, my sisters and I would personalize our clothes — we'd iron on patches and alter them to the way that we wanted them to be, and we'd sketch out designs for fun.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So, why did Chabert opt for comfy-cozy pieces, rather than jeans or something more elaborate?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I don't know about you, but the last couple of years, I feel like so many of us either work from home or are working from home more. Balancing motherhood, my acting career, and now this, I love to be in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>loungewear</a> — it’s about 90% of my closet,” she says. “I feel like I have red carpet gowns and I have leggings, sweatshirts, and T-shirts.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Still, despite being categorized as loungewear, the pieces are super versatile and work for places beyond the home, too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“You could be cuddling on your couch, or you could have coffee with a girlfriend, or you could be volunteering at school and be comfortable and still feel your best.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It was also important for Chabert to include color and prints in her HSN collection.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I think it puts you in a happier mood when you're wearing <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>a bright pop of color,</a>” she says, although admits she is still a big fan of neutrals, which is why she included them as options. “But, there is something to be said for wearing a happy color.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A major draw of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Chabert’s collection</a> is the fact that there’s opportunity to match with a loved one — including your kids. While adult range from from XS to 3X, mini versions of dresses and pullovers come in children’s XS to L.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“[My daughter] Julia loves to match. I know it’s a phase that won't last forever. She'll always ask, ‘Can I have that in the kid version? Can you get that in my size?’ So, there are a few select pieces in the line that are matching Mommy & Me moments.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Still, Chabert adds that you don’t have to twin with your kid — a friend, sibling, cousin, and other people in your life work just as well.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I just had a birthday party for my daughter and my sister and I bought matching outfits to match the theme of the party,” she says. “I love to dress up and make everything an occasion. That was part of the inspiration behind the line — to really celebrate those moments that you spend with your family. There are family pajamas that we have coming out for the holidays and so cute for those Christmas cards. They even have a matching pet sweater.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Speaking of Christmas pajamas, Chabert says you’ll spot a pair in one of her upcoming Hallmark movies, too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I just finished a Christmas movie and I actually wore the Christmas pajamas and another set of pajamas in the film. So when people watch it, if they like it, they can go on HSN and buy it.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Watching a feel-good movie in feel-good clothes? Even Chabert herself is surprised at how perfectly her two passions fit together.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It is similar,” she says. “There are things that are hopefully conveyed in the films I'm a part of that are also a part of this clothing brand.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lacey Chabert’s HSN collection ranges from $45 to $79 and is now available to shop on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>hsn.com</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57y5qanrFdmLWirsSrq2ago6N6pLjOrZ%2BippdisLC4y56araGfo3p3g5NqaGts</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bix-block-parties-coming-to-downtown-davenport.html><span>←</span><span>Bix Block Parties coming to downtown Davenport</span></a>
