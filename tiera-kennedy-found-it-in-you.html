“When I wrote ‘Found It&nbsp;in You,' I knew,” she&nbsp;says.

But now, after my wedding and getting some momentum, I’m thrilled to share the great big production version we made after having Dann&nbsp;Huff join us in the studio."</p><p>Huff is an award-winning producer&nbsp;who has worked with a list of country talents, including <a href=#>Shania Twain</a>, <a href=#>Carrie Underwood</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Glen Campbell</a> and <a href=#>Tanya Tucker</a>. His smart creative direction helped mold an expansive, fresh pop-country sound that's engaging without feeling stale. That rich, layered soundscape perfectly complements Kennedy's vocals, which radiate a warmth and confidence that's sure to connect with fans of artists like <a href=#>Maren Morris</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>Ashley Monroe</a>.</p><p>"The confidence to know that I can be happy /&nbsp;Just 'cause you tell me that you got me," Kennedy sings triumphantly in the song's soaring chorus. "All that I was looking for, I ain't gotta look no more /&nbsp;I found it in you."</p><p>"Found It in You" serves as a strong start for Kennedy, who quickly built a solid fanbase and impressive streaming numbers as an independent artist in recent years.&nbsp;That growing buzz and organic success has landed her on the lineups of multiple country music festivals this year and her own radio show on&nbsp;Apple Music Country, aptly titled the<i><a href=#>&nbsp;Tiera&nbsp;Show</a></i>.</p><p>Country fans can expect to hear more from Kennedy in the months to come as she cements her standing as one of the genre's most intriguing new voices.</p><p><strong>Did You Know?&nbsp;</strong>Kennedy was selected as&nbsp;the&nbsp;flagship artist of hit country songwriter&nbsp;Nicolle Galyon's&nbsp;record label and publishing house, Songs & Daughters. The company, which was launched in 2019, supports female singer-songwriters who want to tell their own stories in the country music space.</p><h3>Tiera Kennedy's 'Found It&nbsp;in You' Lyrics:</h3><p>You're the phone call pickin' up in the middle of the night /&nbsp;You're the patience I don't have when things ain't right /&nbsp;You're the "You can do it, baby" even when I don't wanna try /&nbsp;My mama always said that real good love just hard to find.</p><p><strong>Chorus:</strong></p><p>But I-I-I found it in you /&nbsp;Every little thing that I was missin', baby /&nbsp;You love me a whole different kind of crazy /&nbsp;You got to the heart of me, boy, the best part of me /&nbsp;I-I-I found it in you.</p><p>The confidence to know that I can be happy /&nbsp;Just 'cause you tell me that you got me /&nbsp;All that I was lookin' for, I ain't gotta look no more /&nbsp;I-I-I found it in you, you /&nbsp;I found it in you /&nbsp;I found it in you /&nbsp;I found it in you.</p><p>You can catch me all drеssed up or lettin' all my hair down /&nbsp;Ain't nobody love mе like you love me baby right now /&nbsp;You know how to make a girl smile, yeah, boy, you do /&nbsp;And this girl is wild, wild about you /&nbsp;And baby, I'm glowin', may not always show it /&nbsp;But all I know is..</p><p><strong>Repeat Chorus Twice</strong></p><p>Oh, I found it in you /&nbsp;Just like that boy, I found it in you /&nbsp;And just when I wasn't lookin' / Yeah, my heart, boy, you took it /&nbsp;I found it in you.</p><a class="next-post cto" href=#>Check Out This Month's Top 40 Country Songs</a><figure class="img-tag has-sizer alignnone" readability=2><p><span class=visually-hidden>tiera Kennedy I found it in you</span></p>Big Machine Label Group<p>loading...</p></figure><h2 class=photogallery-title>See the Most Played Country Song from the Year You Were Born</h2><p>Who had the most played country song during the year you were born?
