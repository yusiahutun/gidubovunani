Some become clichÃ©s ("That's classified. If I tell you I'll have to kill you"&nbsp;"“ Top Gun), and some become folklore ("May the Force be with you"&nbsp;"“ Star Wars IV).</p><p>If you are a film buff you have lots of places to revisit and relive them.

Just like any search engine, the accuracy of the results depends on the correctness of what you type in.</p><h2 id=the-moviewavs-page><a href=#>The MovieWavs Page</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Movie-quotes02.jpg><p>At MovieWavs, you get to read and hear the original one-liners from movies and TV shows.

Little emoticons also categorize the quotes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=vorby-no-longer-available>Vorby&nbsp;[No Longer Available]</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Movie-quotes06.jpg><p>At Vorby.com, all quotes are contributed by the community of users.
