The couple exchanged wedding vows in 1999, although they were already in a relationship since 1991. DMX and Tashera welcomed four children, Xavier, Tacoma, Sean, and Praise Mary Ella.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/92d71eb6fb1ec0e2.jpg><p class=align-left>In 2010, Tashera Simmons announced she was separating from DMX. She came out after DMX’s three incarcerations in 2010. In 2012, DMX and Tashera appeared in<i> Couple’s Therapy</i>, a VH1 series, discussing the rapper’s multiple extramarital affairs throughout their marriage.</p><p class=align-left>In 2016, Tashera took DMX to court, accusing him of missing to pay the monthly child support of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$10,000</a>. How many kids has DMX fathered? Details about the number of kids DMX has fathered are somewhat scanty. But in an interview with <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Breakfast Club Power 105.1 FM</a></i> in 2016, DMX revealed that he had 14 children and was expecting the fifteenth child the same year.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f30530185d0da0e5.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Vanilla Ice's family: children, wife, baby mama, parents</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The <a href=#>rapper</a> quickly pointed out that he was unsure whether all his offspring have met. Furthermore, the rapper said he did not have kids in the same county (some were in New York and others in California).

Before his death, the rapper said he had <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">17 children</a>, but more came forward to claim they were his children. So that means he might have more than 17 children. Here is a list of the already known children of DMX and their respective mothers.</p><h3>1.
