He has become a certified online sensation in recent years, making some of the most relatable short videos that social media has to offer.</p><p>Born in Michigan in August 1990, Derek Lipp is an internet personality and social media star who is known for his quirky observational humor and candid videos.</p><p>His short clips tend to feature hilarious mix-ups or relatable comedic moments involving himself, his friends, and his extended family.</p><p>They typically take place within his household or out in everyday settings – such as supermarkets, parks, or schools.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>The Road To Fame</strong></h2><p><br>While plenty of other social media stars have made their fame rapidly in recent years – and exclusively through modern sites like TikTok – Lipp has actually been successful for many years now on a whole range of sites.</p><p>Derek was the creator of a successful Vine account named 2 Guys No Lives, which he ran with his friend Kevin Vincent.</p><p>The site was incredibly popular on Vine between the years of 2013 and 2017.</p><p>It amassed over one million followers, before Vine was eventually shut down.</p><p>The site saw Derek and Kevin perfecting the art of posting hilarious, quickfire videos within the short-form timeframe of 6 – 10 seconds. Their videos all offered zany humour and jokes about the day-to-day experiences of young people.</p><p>Following this, Derek grew his popularity on plenty of other platforms, as he continued to offer funny takes on everyday life.</p><p>He has become popular for his posts relating to family matters – including videos that involve members of his own family – and these videos have seen his following skyrocket in recent years.</p><p>He lists himself as a ‘Video Creator’ on social media sites.</p><h2><strong>Social Media Platforms</strong></h2><p><br>Lipp became popular on Vine, but has since moved on to become popular on plenty of other social networks.</p><p>Derek is a major name on Instagram, where he has over 1.6 million followers.</p><p>He has also been on YouTube since 2014, where he has over 1.4 million subscribers, and a staggering 1.1 BILLION views+, over his 373 videos.</p><p>Derek Lipp’s TikTok has also skyrocketed in the last five years. He now has 8.2 million followers, over a billion views, as well as 380 million individual likes.</p><h2><strong>Wife/Girlfriend</strong></h2><p>With Lipp’s family being such a firm feature of his viral videos, it’s only right that his fans would be curious about his love life and his relationship status.</p><p>Derek Lipp often shared videos with his partner Kay (kkalieghjonn on Instagram). Kay is the mother of Derek’s daughter, Evelyn Rose.</p><p>Derek Lipp’s marital status is not clear. However, Kay and Derek have been together for several years.</p><p>Many of Derek’s fans have noted that he has a playlist titled ‘Ex Wife’ on his <a href=# rel=noopener>TikTok page</a>.</p><p>The playlist features Derek and his friend’s ex-wife engaging in funny conversations, normally through the medium of a doorbell app which captures Derek and his friends entering and leaving the house.</p><p>However, the playlist does not involve Derek talking or videoing his actual ex-wife, and there is no suggestion that he was married before meeting his current partner.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Children</strong></h2><p><br>Derek Lipp has two children – a son and daughter – both of whom regularly appear in his videos and reels.</p><p>Derek’s son is named Dawson Lipp. He was born on December 21, 2014, making him 9 years old.</p><p>Dawson frequently stars in humorous father-son-related videos – as well as videos related to football or other sports. These videos have made Dawson something of a viral star in his own right.</p><p>Lipp also announced the birth of his daughter, Evelyn Rose, in the summer of 2022.</p><p>He shared a message on Instagram saying, ‘Evelyn Rose Lipp. She’s perfect’ – with a heart emoji – on July 28, 2022. Evelyn Rose has appeared in several videos since then.</p><p>It is not known at this moment whether or not Derek Lipp and his partner are planning on having more children in the future.</p><h2><strong>Net Worth</strong></h2><p>With millions of followers and hundreds of millions of views yearly, many have wondered what Derek Lipp’s net worth is. Lipp earned most of his wealth from his ability to monetize his vast social media empire, as well as various other business ventures such as merchandising. Therefore, Derek Lipp has an estimated net worth of $2 million.</p><p>While Derek Lipp has never revealed exactly how much he is worth, the social media star himself has <a href=#>poked fun at suggestions about his net worth</a>. In a video he posted online in late 2023, Derek is seen arguing with his son Dawson about money. Dawson then asks a digital assistant to conduct a search of Derek Lipp’s net worth.</p><p>The digital assistant reveals through a household speaker that Derek’s net worth is $5 million.</p><p>However, Derek himself can be heard in the video saying: “That is not right, I don’t have 5 million dollars. I don’t even think I have 5 bucks!” He later added in a comment: “I’m no longer looking up anyone’s net worth. Someone just guesses.”</p><p>At the current moment, we can only provide estimations about Derek Lipp’s exact net worth, as the social media star has not yet talked publicly about how much he has earned from his viral stardom.</p><h3><strong>Merch</strong></h3><p>Derek Lipp has his own merchandise range, ‘Roof Beers,’ which is named after a viral video that Derek created. On his shop website, Derek sells t-shirts and hoodies as part of his Signature Collection.</p><h2 style=text-align:center><strong>READ THIS NEXT:</strong></h2><p style=text-align:center><a href=#>Gukesh D Net Worth</a></p><p style=text-align:center><a href=#>What is Pavel Durov’s net worth</a>?</p><p style=text-align:center><a href=#>How much is Fanum worth</a>?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaK8tr%2FPnqappJWpvKWt2GeaqKVfmbKzscpmo6KooGK7psCMsKarrJhk</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fderek-lipp-net-worth.html&text=Derek%20Lipp%20Net%20Worth%20%242%20Million&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fderek-lipp-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fderek-lipp-net-worth.html&title=Derek%20Lipp%20Net%20Worth%20%242%20Million" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fderek-lipp-net-worth.html&title=Derek%20Lipp%20Net%20Worth%20%242%20Million" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fderek-lipp-net-worth.html&title=Derek%20Lipp%20Net%20Worth%20%242%20Million" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fderek-lipp-net-worth.html&description=Derek%20Lipp%20Net%20Worth%20%242%20Million" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./pedestrian-struck-airlifted-in-hazlet-crash.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Pedestrian Struck, Airlifted In Hazlet Crash">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-furby-retrospective.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="25 Years Ago, The Most Annoying Toy Also Became The Most Threatening">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
