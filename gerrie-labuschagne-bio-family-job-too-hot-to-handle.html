She caught the interest of several men and was for sure the most popular girl throughout the season.</p><p>Georgia had come on the show to hook up with every narcissist in the area. She said bad boys are her type.</p><p>On the other hand, Gerrie was the last to enter the villa. Be that as it may, he was still able to attract several ladies with his incredible physique and appearance. Georgia especially loved his down-to-earth personality, and the two decided to get together to see where fate would take them.</p><p>At first, Gerrie and Georgia seemed quite committed, and no questions could have been raised about their chemistry. Fans were surprised by their dedication to their relationship and were overjoyed for Georgia that she finally found someone with whom she felt comfortable.</p><p>Viewers even saw the couple promise to make it till the end. But, everything changed when Georgia decided to reflect on her feelings. From what she said, she was still not in a place to commit. She said that she realized that a long-lasting relationship with Gerrie was not really on her agenda. And so, unwilling to lead Gerrie on, she opened up about her issues before parting ways.</p><p>So, they are no longer together and if in case Georgia changed her mind there was nothing to suggest that they reconnected post-filming.</p><p>These two also did not find a connection with someone else on the show, thus had gone home&nbsp;without a partner.</p><p style=text-align:left>In the meantime, Gerrie happens to mention ‘single’ as his relationship status, over Facebook.</p><p>So you know, Gerrie reportedly dated beautiful Whitney Williams of Tillamook, Oregon before he decided to pursue romance in a reality game show.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Gerrie Labuschagne Job</strong></h3><p>Gerrie Lagbuschagne is a fitness coach and other than that a professional rugby player.
