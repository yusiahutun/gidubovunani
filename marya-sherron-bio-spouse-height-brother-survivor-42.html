She was a “super weird kid” and has always wanted to prove to the world that “you can be weird and don’t have to change yourself to succeed.” No wonder, she joined </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Survivor 42 —</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> a competitive reality television series, where you can prove yourself and also win a grand prize of $1 million.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Keep reading this Marya Sherron Bio to learn more about her.</span></p><h3><b>Marya Sherron On Survivor 42</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>CBS series, </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Survivor</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> returned for its 42nd season on March 9, 2022, and as always, it saw brand new 18 competitors including Marya Sherron, traveling to the islands from different backgrounds.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Joining Marya this season were her co-stars — Chanelle Howell, Daniel Strunk, Drea Wheeler, Hai Giang, Jackson Fox, Jenny Kim, Jonathan Young, Lindsay Dolashewich, Lydia Meredith, Maryanne Oketch, Mike Turner, Omar Zaheer, Rocksroy Bailey, Romeo Escobar, Swati Goel, Tori Meehan, and Zach Wurtenberger.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>According to Marya, she’s always been a </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Survivor</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> fan. The first season she remembers watching was David vs. Goliath. However, even before she started watching the show, Marya used to be a fan of a parody show of </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Survivor</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. “So it was always in the back of my mind,” she explained.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>And now that she finds herself on the show, Marya compares herself with the past participants, Angelina and Tony. Like Angelin, she wants to slip under the radar, but as Tony, she will maintain an upbeat personality, and not become a threat initially.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, Marya revealed that her game plan was similar to that of Sarah Lacina, and will not hesitate to stab her friends in the back.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>However, one person, she admits she resonates with the most was Vecepia (the first person to orchestrate a flip, which changed the whole tone of the game.)&nbsp; “I see myself in her,” Marya remarked.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>So, since she doesn’t mind stabbing her friends in the back, Marya wants an alliance partner who’s on the same level of threat as hers. She was looking for someone risky. Someone who’s like, “We gotta go one more vote. Okay, now’s the time to go and fight against each other,” she explained.</span></p><p><b>Spoilers Alert:</b><span style=font-weight:400> Unfortunately, Jackson Fox was forced to leave the show as he hid his necessary medication from production until the day before filming. At the time, he was taking lithium to manage sleep problems.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Apart from that, Zach Wurtenberger was also eliminated from the show. He became the first player to be voted off of </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Survivor 42</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. Also, the vote against Zach marked Survivor history as the first unanimous vote in 42 seasons.</span></p><h3><b>Marya Sherron Spouse</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Marya Sherron’s spouse David Sherron is an Indianapolis native who ran </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Unto Him Ministries</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> — a ministry addressing various needs of people throughout the community.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, he was employed at </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>UCB (Union Chimique Belge)</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, a multinational biopharmaceutical company.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As of 2022, David was 64 years of age.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>On David’s 64th birthday (i,.e. On December 17, 2021), Marya took it to her IG to share a montage of memories, captioned, “Life with you is crazy, stupid good. Thank you for blessing me continually, loving me unconditionally, and teaching me often.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, Marya added that he was the only man she knew who spent his birthday every year buying Christmas presents for children in need. What a man!</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Talking about Marya’s kids, she has two songs named Trive James Smith and Dylan Sherron.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As of 2022, her eldest was already attending college while her youngest was still in middle school.</span></p><h3><b>How Old Is Marya Sherron?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Marya Sherron was 47 years of age when she appeared on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Survivor 42</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> in 2022.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>She was the third oldest contestant that season. The oldest was Mike Turner at 58 while the second oldest was Jackson Fox at 48.</span></p><h3><b>What Happened To Marya Sherron’s Brother?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Marya Sherron’s brother Kious Kelly lost his life to COVID-19 on March 24, 2020. He was working in the front lines as a nurse in New York then.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Talking a little about him, Kious initially moved to New York City in 1993 to pursue a career in dancing, but New York is not an easy place to make it. Thus, he eventually enrolled in nursing school at </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>New York University</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> and started working as a registered nurse after graduating in 2012.</span></p><h3><b>Marya Sherron Height</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Marya Sherron stands tall at a height above 5 feet 5 inches (165 cm).</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Her distinct features include — curled hair and a dimpled smile.</span></p><h3><b>Marya Sherron Job</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Marya Sherron was working as a “Dean of Homeschool, Director of Entertainment, and Domestic Engineer” at </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>DreamWorks Home</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> as of 2022. Also, early that year she founded </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>KI Productions</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> and operated from there.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Before that, she worked as an English instructor at</span><i><span style=font-weight:400> Ivy Tech Community College</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> (from August 2019 to 2020), and as an Adjunct Professor at </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Columbia College Chicago</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> (from Jan 2000 to 2008).</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Besides this, Marya has had teaching jobs at </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Horizon Christian School </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>and</span><i><span style=font-weight:400> UHM.</span></i></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>For all her hard work, back in May 2002, she was honored with the “Distinguished Educator of the Year” award by Columbia College Teaching Fellows.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As for her education, Marya attended the </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>University of Michigan</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> from 1992 to 1996 for her bachelor’s degree in black studies. She then went on to join the University of Wisconsin-Madison from 1996 to 1998 for her master’s in black studies. Finally, she then received her degree in master of fine arts from </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Columbia College Chicago</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> in 2000.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>When Marya wasn’t working, she spend her time gardening, writing (poetry and spoken word), and doing Pilates.</span></p><h3><b>Is Marya Sherron On Instagram?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Yes, find her on Instagram @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>maryapatricesherron</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, here’s Facebook @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>marya.patrice.5</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>, and Twitter @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>SherronMarya</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li style=font-weight:400><h4><b>When Is Marya Sherron Birthday?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>Marya Sherron celebrates her birthday on June 1.</span></p><ul><li style=font-weight:400><h4><b>What Is Marya Sherron Ethnicity?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>This self-described “spicy, smart, and loving” star Marya Sherron is of mixed ethnicity.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As of 2022, she resided in Indianapolis, Indiana.</span></p><ul><li style=font-weight:400><h4><b>Who Are Marya Sherron Parents?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>Marya Sherron was born to her parents, Marion and Karen Smith.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Forever thankful to them, Marya shared that her dad was always there for her.
