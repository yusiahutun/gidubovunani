More on that skit later, but for now, let’s go full throttle into everything fans need to know about a possible&nbsp;Cars&nbsp;4.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/cars-4-pixar-everett-collection-embed.jpg><h2>The Cars Franchise So Far</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>For those that haven’t seen it,&nbsp;Cars&nbsp;was created by <strong>John Lasseter</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;takes place in a world populated by talking vehicles — cars included. In the first film, Lightning (Owen) gets lost on his way to California in a race and ends up in Radiator Springs, a small town on Route 66. Lightning’s car is wrecked, and so he’s forced to remain in the town, which leads to him meeting new BFF Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) and Sally Carrera (<strong>Bonnie Hunt</strong>), whom he falls in love with. Other characters introduced include Doc Hudson (<strong>Paul Newman</strong>), Luigi (<strong>Tony Shaloub</strong>), Ramone (<strong>Cheech Marin</strong>), The King (<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Richard Petty</strong></a>), Chick Hicks (<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Michael Keaton</strong></a>) and more. At the end of the first movie, Lightning sets up his very own racing headquarters in Radiator Springs.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>In&nbsp;Cars 2, Lightning competes in the first World Grand Prix in Europe, but he accidentally gets sucked into some international espionage drama. New characters in the second film include Finn McMissle (<strong>Michael Caine</strong>), Holley Shiftwell (<strong>Emily Mortimer</strong>), Francesco Bernoulli (<strong>John Turturro</strong>), Sir Miles Axlerod (<strong>Eddie Izzard</strong>) and Professor Zundapp (<strong>Thomas Kretschmann</strong>). Six years later,&nbsp;Cars 3&nbsp;came out and explored Lightning teaching a new generation of race cars. Some of those newbies included Cruz Ramirez (<strong>Cristela Alonzo</strong>), Smokey (<strong>Chris Cooper</strong>), Sterling (<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Nathan Fillion</strong></a>), Jackson Storm (<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Armie Hammer</strong></a>), and Natalie Certain (<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kerry Washington</strong></a>). At the end of the third film, Lightning decides to set his own racing career aside for the time being to train Cruz for the upcoming Piston Cup season.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/cars-4-pixar-everett-collection-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10>The Cars&nbsp;franchise has expanded beyond just the three films. There’s been two spin-off films,&nbsp;Planes&nbsp;and&nbsp;Planes: Fire & Rescue, that were released by Disneytoon Studios. There’s also been a few TV spin-offs called&nbsp;Car Toons that aired on Disney Channel and ABC Family.&nbsp;The animated spinoff series Cars on the Road is coming to Disney+ in September 2022 and will follow Lightning and Mater traveling the country.</p><h2>What We Know About ‘Cars 4’</h2><p id=content-paragraph-11>All three&nbsp;Cars&nbsp;movies received positive reviews from fans and critics alike. In total, the films grossed over $1.4 billion in box office revenue worldwide. The first&nbsp;Cars&nbsp;was even nominated for the <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Academy Award</a> for Best Animated Feature in 2007, but it lost out to&nbsp;Happy Feet. So based on all that, it’s likely Pixar/Disney would want to continue the successful franchise. However, the studios have lately been turning their attention towards creating original movies (like&nbsp;Soul,&nbsp;Onward and&nbsp;Luca), rather than creating sequels to their franchises like&nbsp;Toy Story&nbsp;and&nbsp;Cars.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/cars-4-pixar-everett-collection-embed-1.jpg alt=Cars width=620 height=347 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p id=content-paragraph-13>The good news is, some of the faces behind&nbsp;Cars&nbsp;have said before that a fourth movie is possible. “Like any sequel, from <i>Toy Story 4</i> to <i>Incredibles 2</i>, as long as there’s a good story to tell it’s worth investing, we do love these characters, we love them as much as the public does,” producers <strong>Kevin Reher</strong> and <strong>Andrea Warren</strong> said <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>back in 2017</a>. Meanwhile, Owen said at a&nbsp;Cars 3&nbsp;press event that he has personal hopes for what a fourth film could be about. “I would imagine that if they do do another one, it’ll be something pretty cool,” the actor <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>said</a>. “But yeah maybe like Lightning McQueen in sort of like a thriller. Maybe that could be something.”</p><h2>In the Meantime, SNL Has Some Ideas…</h2><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-14>If Pixar/Disney needs some inspiration for Cars 4, look no further than Owen’s hysterical&nbsp;SNL&nbsp;skit. Owen parodied a possible fourth film by uttering a series of innuendos and expletives while doing the voice acting for the fake movie. The scene also features <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Mikey Day</strong></a> and <strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Punkie Johnson</a>&nbsp;</strong>as Pixar executives leading Owen during the recording session. Owen’s co-star Larry (he voices Mater, in case you forgot) even appears and reads his lines beside Owen. Larry mentions the “R-word,” which Owen objects to. “This is a complete betrayal of a beloved character and I don’t want any part of it.” But Owen’s tune quickly changes when the executives show him his contract from Disney — and that gets Owen back on track for the job. We’re really hoping that this&nbsp;SNL&nbsp;skit will send Pixar/Disney into full speed ahead on creating Cars 4!</p><h2>Cars on the Road</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/cars-4-pixar-everett-collection-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-15>The&nbsp;Cars on the Road&nbsp;spinoff series was officially announced in November 2021 on Disney+ Day.

These episodes are filled with lots of fun new characters, imaginative destinations as well as old friends checking in along the way.” <strong>Steve Purcell</strong> wrote the series while&nbsp;<strong>Pete Docter</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Marc Sondheimer</strong>&nbsp;are the producers.
