Kraven, a classic Spider-Man villain, created by <strong>Stan Lee</strong> and <strong>Steve Ditko</strong>, and a founding member of the Sinister Six, was teased in <strong>The Amazing Spider-Man 2</strong> (2014). In Marvel Comics, Kraven is depicted as a Russian nobleman whose family was compelled to immigrate to America in 1917 due to the February Revolution. Kraven became an obsessive big game hunter and, after mastering the sport, made Spider-Man his target in an effort to establish himself as the world's best hunter. In 2014, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 director <strong>Marc Webb</strong> indicated an interest in seeing the character in a movie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After several years of considering a Kraven movie, Sony became interested in a standalone film for the character in 2017. <strong>Richard Wenk</strong> was then hired to write a screenplay for <strong>Kraven the Hunter</strong> in August 2018 and Sony confirmed that the film was in development in March 2019. Surprisingly, before learning that Sony owned the cinematic rights to Kraven, filmmaker <strong>Ryan Coogler</strong> had wanted to feature the character in his MCU film <strong>Black Panther</strong>. The upcoming movie will thus give Kraven a well-deserved introduction to Sony's shared superhero universe.</p><p>Editor's Note: This article was updated on April 28, 2024.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/kraven-the-hunter-new-film-poster.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Kraven the Hunter">Kraven the Hunter</a></h5>ActionAdventure Sci-Fi<p class=display-card-description></p><p data-testid=plot>Russian immigrant Sergei Kravinoff is on a mission to prove that he is the greatest hunter in the world.</p><strong>Release Date</strong> <span>August 30, 2024</span> <strong>Director</strong> <span>J.C.

However,<a href=#> <strong>the producers swiftly decided to cast Aaron Taylor-Johnson after being blown away by early footage of his role in the 2022 action-comedy Bullet Train.</strong></a> He is most known for playing the title character in <strong>Kick-Ass</strong> and its sequel as well as <a href=#>Pietro Maximoff in<strong> Avengers: Age of Ultron</strong></a> in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</p><p>In March 2022, it was announced that<a href=#> Academy Award-winning actress <strong>Ariana DeBose</strong></a> would be taking on the role of Calypso. In the comics, Calypso serves Kraven's love interest and a voodoo priestess who uses magic potions. In Marvel Comics, Calypso is typically portrayed as Spider-Man's adversary. Fans can anticipate that the filmmakers will explore the couple's romantic relationship in the movie. DeBose received tremendous acclaim for her performance as Anita in Steven Spielberg's <strong>West Side Story</strong>. Additionally, she played Alyssa Greene in Ryan Murphy's musical movie <strong>The Prom</strong> and Emma Tate in the Apple TV+ musical comedy series <strong>Schmigadoon!</strong>. <strong>Jodie Turner-Smith</strong> was initially rumored to be playing the role of Calypso</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#><strong>Alessandro Nivola</strong></a><strong> </strong>was recently revealed to be playing the film's main villain, the iconic Spider-Man villain the Rhino. The character was previously portrayed by <strong>Paul Giamatti</strong> in 2014 in <strong>The Amazing Spider-Man 2,</strong> but Nivola's take on the Rhino will be much different. With a vast list of acting achievements, Nivola is most known for his role as Nicolas Cage's brother Pollux Troy in <strong>John Woo's</strong> 1997 film <strong>Face/Off</strong>. He starred alongside <strong>Christian Bale</strong> and <strong>Margot Robbie</strong> in <strong>David O. Russell's</strong><strong>Amsterdam</strong> in 2022, as well in the comedy <strong>Spin Me Round</strong> alongside <strong>Alison Brie</strong> and <strong>Aubrey Plaza</strong>. His other well-known films are <strong>One Percent More Humid</strong> and <strong>The Red Sea Diving Resort</strong>.</p><p><a href=#>The other antagonist will be played by <strong>Christopher Abbott</strong></a>, which will reportedly be the Foreigner. Nivola is known for playing Mason Tannetti in <strong>The Sinner</strong> and Charlie Dattolo in the HBO comedy-drama series <strong>Girls</strong>.

He is a master of disguises, known for his ability to impersonate virtually anybody. He is best known for playing Trevor in <strong>Eighth Grade</strong>, John Calley in <strong>News of the World</strong>, and Ethan Russell in <strong>The Woman in the Window</strong>. Additionally, he appeared in the first season of the renowned HBO anthology series <strong>The White Lotus</strong> as well as the<strong> Fear Street </strong>Trilogy. Academy Award nominee<strong> Kodi Smit-McPhee </strong>who is most known for playing the role of Peter in <strong>The Power of the Dog</strong> and Nightcrawler in <strong>X-Men: Apocalypse</strong> and<strong> Dark Phoenix </strong>was initially approached for the role, but ultimately turned the role down.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Academy Award-winning actor <a href=#><strong>Russell Crowe</strong></a> will be playing the role of Kraven's father, with whom he has a complicated relationship with.

While most superhero films are rated PG-13, the success of the <strong>Deadpool </strong>films encouraged studios to aim for the rating more frequently with their superhero movies, with films like<strong> Logan</strong>, <strong>Joker</strong>, <strong>Birds of Prey</strong>, <strong>The Suicide Squad</strong>, and <strong>Zack Snyder's Justice League</strong>, all landing R-ratings.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibn6G5qrDEq2Wcp51kuLOt1Z6lZqyYmnqpwc2tnKtlnaTDqrGMq5ylnZGosm6wwK2cZpuRqMFussilpKKml2Q%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fkraven-the-hunter-movie-release-date-cast-filming.html&text=Everything%20We%20Know%20so%20Far%20About%20the%20Spider-Man%20Spinoff&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkraven-the-hunter-movie-release-date-cast-filming.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkraven-the-hunter-movie-release-date-cast-filming.html&title=Everything%20We%20Know%20so%20Far%20About%20the%20Spider-Man%20Spinoff" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fkraven-the-hunter-movie-release-date-cast-filming.html&title=Everything%20We%20Know%20so%20Far%20About%20the%20Spider-Man%20Spinoff" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fkraven-the-hunter-movie-release-date-cast-filming.html&title=Everything%20We%20Know%20so%20Far%20About%20the%20Spider-Man%20Spinoff" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkraven-the-hunter-movie-release-date-cast-filming.html&description=Everything%20We%20Know%20so%20Far%20About%20the%20Spider-Man%20Spinoff" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./new-girl-review-elaines-big-day.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="New Girl Review: Elaines Big Day (Season 2, Episode 25)">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./lollapalooza-2015-lineup.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="2015 Lollapalooza Lineup Revealed">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
