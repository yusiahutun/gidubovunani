In fact, it was his career as a street seller that transformed him from an international diver to a Hollywood star.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/09/GettyImages-1496779639-721x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jason-statham-sold-knock-off-jewelry-on-the-street-before-his-big-break>Jason Statham sold knock-off jewelry on the street before his big break</h2><p id=par-2_98>Born in July 1967 to Eileen and Barry Statham, Jason found his calling in sports as a talented footballer and diver. He was eventually inducted into the British National Diving School in 1985 and went on to represent Great Britain and England internationally.</p><p>He participated in the 1988 and 1992 Olympic trials but failed to make the cut. Statham was also hired as a model for his masculine and relatable look. During this time, he followed his father’s footsteps as a seller, offering “fake jewelry and perfume on street corners.”</p><p>The actor admitted that he never told his customers they were counterfeit products, but “some people were stupid enough to think that it was solid gold.”</p><p>“You let them think it’s nicked and that’s their fault. If they think it’s gold, then they’re even stupider,” he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told</a> Daily Mail. “Why would I be selling four chains for £10 if they’re solid gold? I’d need my brains testing.”</p><p>When asked if he ever went against his morals during his “black market” dealings, Jason confessed that he occasionally felt bad when buyers realized they had purchased a fake product. “You’d have to have your own judgment at that time whether they get their money back or not,” he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recalled</a> to Sway’s Universe. “But usually, I’m trying to make money, so I’m not trying to behave like Barneys,”</p><p>The Fast And Furious actor was never jailed for his dishonest dealings and he does not have a criminal record.</p><p>Two years later, he received a call from Guy Ritchie to portray Bacon, a small-time criminal, in Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-check-out-jason-statham-during-his-modeling-and-diving-days>Check out Jason Statham during his modeling and diving days</h2><p>Here he is flipping off springboard at the Commonwealth Games in Auckland in 1990.
