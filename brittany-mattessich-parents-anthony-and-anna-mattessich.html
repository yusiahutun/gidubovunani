For part of us went with you, the day God called you home. You left us beautiful memories, Your love is still our guide. And although we cannot see you, You are always at our side. Our family chain is broken, And nothing seems the same, But as God calls us one by one, the chain will link again. 💕👼 I will forever be your little princess 💕🙏 R.I.P.
