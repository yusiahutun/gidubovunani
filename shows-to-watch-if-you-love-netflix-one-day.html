The perfect will-they-won’t-they show to watch if you have a One Day-shaped hole in your lives.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d88c5c207ca5-lovesick2.jpg><h3>Starstruck - BBC I Player</h3><p id=eK-cgJuSiwF data-wc=74>After a chance encounter on New Year’s Day, odd-jobbing Jessie accidentally strikes up a romance with Tom, an A-list actor. But being some such different worlds - with Tom on shoots, awards shows and with a flashy flat - and Jessie barely able to make ends meet - will they find a way to make it work? Like One Day, you spend plenty of episodes wishing that this pair would just get it together!</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Starstruck's season three trailer</figure><h3>Catastrophe - Channel 4&nbsp;</h3><p id=ec---8OYIF74 data-wc=63>After a one-night stand, primary school teacher Sharon discovers that she’s pregnant and that American advertising executive, Rob, is the father. With a certain time limit on their hands until becoming parents, Rob moves to London to see if they can make a relationship work - despite barely knowing one another. If you like One Day’s razor-sharp humour, this is one for you.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ce0c920efaf5-catastrophe-1.jpg><h3>Feel Good - Netflix&nbsp;</h3><p id=e5oHyXG1UJvJ data-wc=64>After George meets Mae during Mae’s stand-up routine at a comedy club, they begin a relationship with one another. However, all isn’t smooth sailing as they have to deal with George’s elusiveness when it comes to coming out and telling her friends and family about her relationship with Mae, while learning that Mae is a recovering drug addict. Sweet, affecting and very, very funny.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1d0f4143defc-feelgoods2unit18jpgfeelgoods2unit18.jpg><h3>Last Tango in Halifax - BBC iPlayer</h3><p id=ehp7sSwJ16cE data-wc=67>Single pensioners Celia and Alan reconnect after 60 years - after a misunderstanding meant that they failed to go on a date as teenagers. Grabbing life with both hands, the pair decide to get married - much to the surprise of their respective grown-up daughters, Caroline and Gillian. Much like Emma, this show is full of Northern wit and charm - and we couldn’t recommend it more.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/16b1664566c8-last-tango-in-halifax.jpg><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="One Day star Ambika Mod reveals deeply personal reason she initially rejected lead role" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/698996550d3c-one-day-ambika-mod.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="One Day star Ambika Mod reveals deeply personal reason she initially rejected lead role" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>One Day star Ambika Mod reveals deeply personal reason she initially rejected lead role</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="One Day star Eleanor Tomlinson has a famous family: from singer mum to actor brother" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/3582ff5ee505-eleanor-tomlinson-netflix.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="One Day star Eleanor Tomlinson has a famous family: from singer mum to actor brother" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>One Day star Eleanor Tomlinson has a famous family: from singer mum to actor brother</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="SAG Awards 2024: How to watch, nominees and host revealed" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/4110cee0756a-emma-stone-holding-a-sag-award.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="SAG Awards 2024: How to watch, nominees and host revealed" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>SAG Awards 2024: How to watch, nominees and host revealed</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><h3>Normal People - BBC iPlayer</h3><p id=eKD_rITb9A3e data-wc=94>If you watched One Day because you fancied an absolute sob-fest, we have your next watch all lined up. Much like One Day, it follows a ‘popular’ boy and a somewhat insecure girl who fall for one another. Connell is one of the popular kids when he falls in love with Marianne, one of his wealthy peers who is shunned by her classmates for being ‘different’. The pair’s on-and-off romance is beautifully told - and made stars of Paul Mescal and Daisy Edgar-Jones.
