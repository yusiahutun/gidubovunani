While this issue is rare, it does happen, and Apple is aware of it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You might see a message saying something like "iMessage activation unsuccessful." You might also get a message that says "waiting for activation." Unfortunately, you can't use iMessage or FaceTime if either of these pop-up.</p><p>If you're experiencing this issue, you might be frustrated as you probably want to use iMessage on your new Apple device immediately. Fortunately, there are some things you can do.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong><strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=restart-your-iphone>1. Restart Your iPhone</h2><p>Before you get into any technical fixes, it's important to restart your iPhone. This will typically fix most issues on your iPhone. Doing this will clear data, restart your network connections, and refresh your messages.</p><p>To restart your device, simply turn it off, wait 30 seconds, and then turn it back on. If this solves your issue, that's great. If not, please proceed to the next fix.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=set-your-apple-id-to-send-and-receive-imessages>2. Set Your Apple ID to Send and Receive iMessages</h2><p>If there is an issue with sending and receiving messages or your iMessage activation is unsuccessful, be sure to check your Send & Receive settings. If this isn't properly enabled, your iMessage activation won't be successful.

Reset Network Settings</h2><p>Resetting your network settings will reset all of your settings related to your cellular network and Wi-Fi connections. This will resolve many issues related to your network connection, which could be preventing iMessage from being successfully activated.</p><p>Resetting your network settings is faster than a factory reset, and it targets all the settings you'd need to restore to factory defaults without reinstalling all of your apps or erasing all your data.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/iphone-general-settings.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/iphone-reset-settings.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/reset-network-settings-iphone.jpg> <span class=txt>Close</span><p>To reset your network settings, head to <strong>Settings > General > Transfer or Reset iPhone > Reset > Reset Network Settings</strong>.

This is one of the most common issues, but remember that iMessage and FaceTime rely on Wi-Fi or cellular data to connect to the internet.</p><p>So, check your cellular or Wi-Fi connection to see if you can access the web. One way to check this would be to go to Safari and navigate to any webpage. If you don't have an internet connection or the web page won't load, this is a sign that you should connect to the internet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In case you're having issues connecting, consider <a href=#>resetting your iPhone's network settings</a>.

Check Your Time Zone Settings</h2><p>Some users claim that if an Apple Device's time zone settings are wrong, you'll run into iPhone activation issues. While this issue isn't widely reported, some users online claim that fixing their time zone helps.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ios-settings-menu-highlighting-general.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/date-and-time-settings-in-ios.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/setting-date-and-time-manually-in-ios.jpg> <span class=txt>Close</span><p>To do this on an iPhone or iPad, head to <strong>Settings > General > Date & Time > Time Zone</strong> and update your time zone to the one you're currently in. You'll need to toggle off <strong>Set Automatically</strong> to be able to do this.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you're on the border of two time zones, try switching to the other time zone. If you're using a new carrier, your carrier might have a tower in the nearby time zone and not the one you're in, causing activation issues.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/date-and-time-zone-settings-in-macos-ventura-1.jpg><p>To do the same on a Mac, head to<strong> System Settings > General > Date & Time</strong> and change your time zone settings here. In older versions of macOS, you'll need to go to <strong>System Preferences > Date & Time</strong> to access these options.</p><h2 id=check-apple-39-s-server-status>7. Check Apple's Server Status</h2><p>If you've tried all the above fixes and still can't resolve your problem, be sure to visit <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple's System Status page</a> and see if iMessage service is up and running.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/apple-server-status.png><p>While rare, there is a possibility that Apple's servers might be down. If a server is down, particularly the iMessage server, then your iMessage won't activate until Apple fixes this issue.</p><p>If you see that the iMessage server is down, you have no choice but to wait until Apple fixes its backend.</p><h2 id=imessage-won-39-t-activate-wait-24-hours>iMessage Won't Activate? Wait 24 Hours</h2><p>iMessage can take up to 24 hours to activate on new devices. While many users activate it right away, a poor internet connection or issues with your carrier can delay this process. However, it should never take more than 24 hours.</p><p>If you've waited more than 24 hours and iMessage still won't activate, Apple recommends contacting its support team. When <a href=#>contacting Apple Support</a>, tell them you restarted iMessage and FaceTime and that you're connected to the internet. Apple will ask you to do these things first, so letting them know you did this can speed up the process.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once you reach out to Apple after trying the above fixes, Apple will check for any issues you might not notice from your end.</p><h2 id=unsuccessful-imessage-activation-there-39-s-a-fix>Unsuccessful iMessage Activation? There's a Fix</h2><p>If your iMessage activation is unsuccessful, there is a fix. Apple wants you to be able to use iMessage, and this not working poses a problem for the company. This is why most issues with iMessage are fixable, and Apple is aware of the known issues.</p><p>iMessage still won't activate after trying all these fixes? You have no choice but to take your iPhone, iPad, or Mac to an Apple Store. Or, go to the store where you purchased your device. You'll rarely need to do this, but it's always an option if iMessage still won't activate.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGifqK9dqbxussixZK6mo6qwpLHSrJ2upF2WsLW11ZqroqeeYrausdKsmKCdXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./exclusive-pictures-kesha-shows-body-confidence-bright-bathing-suit-beach-day-longtime-love-html.html><span>←</span><span>Kesha shows off in bright bathing suit on LA beach day with boyfriend Brad Ashenfelter</span></a>
