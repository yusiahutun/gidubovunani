She was followed by 2011 champion Komova, who had fallen off her signature apparatus during the women's team final in which Russia finished fourth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/486w/public/2015/11/02/tpbje2015110117d.jpg>This time the 20-year-old made no mistake, dismounting cleanly as intended only to see she had earned the same score as Fan. Both then stood side by side watching expectantly as next Kocian and then Spiridonova performed only to see the same mark appear on the scoreboard to gasps of disbelief and laughter.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"I am personally shocked," said Komova. "It's the first time judges had such a hard time deciding on the champion on bars."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The scores are divided into difficulty and execution. Fan's performance was the most difficult while Kocian and Komova scored highest for execution. But when the scores were added together they all came to the same mark.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"It made me laugh to see four gymnasts with the same score, but I'm happy for all of the other gold medallists," said Fan.</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: China's Fan shares amazing four-way tie for gold</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1mnKCZo65wrdGtoJyklWR%2BeYOTcG1pZ5Odtq%2Bt0madmqZdrrattc1mqqGZoprAbq3MmrGippdis7DB0WaumrFdqbamecaoo51lp6S%2FrbCMoLCmppGowaqv0g%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bella-hadid-defends-style-responds-criticism.html><span>←</span><span>Bella Hadid Doesn't Care If You Don't Like Her Style</span></a>
