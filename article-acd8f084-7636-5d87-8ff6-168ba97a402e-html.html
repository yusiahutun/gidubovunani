The Knights' lone victory in the stretch was a 74-63 decision vs. Oklahoma on Feb. 3. Nils Machowski scored 11 points for UCF, which forced 17 BYU turnovers, with 11 of those coming in the second half thanks to a pressure defense. The Knights also lost to the Cougars at home 63-58 on Jan. 13, and they are 1-5 in road games during Big 12 play. BYU used a 16-2 run bridging the first and second halves to take a 44-26 lead.

UCF pulled within 72-65 with 4:10 left after Darius Johnson made a layup and two free throws following a flagrant foul. But BYU surged to a 80-69 edge on a 3-pointer from Robinson with 2:12 remaining. UCF made four 3-pointers and scored 15 points in the final 54 seconds to pull within two points with 0.7 seconds remaining before BYU held on. The Cougars jumped out to a 10-0 lead before the Knights scored their first basket on a jumper from Antwann Jones 4:50 into the game. The Cougars led 39-26 at halftime.
