It is a dream come true because that was our objective when we began publishing the Voice Journal in 2004,” 42-year-old editor-in-chief Kyaw Min Shwe said Sunday, as reporters hustled around his newsroom to put out their first edition.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He said the established government newspapers have an advantage in terms of money and distribution, but “I can say with absolute confidence that we can compete with government papers in terms of content and quality of news.”</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">I will print my first daily edition on May 3, Press Freedom Day, because it is very symbolicDr Than Htut Aung, CEO, Eleven media group</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Despite the new reforms, the draconian 1962 Printing and Registration Act remains in place until a new media law is enacted. It carries a maximum seven-year prison term for failure to register and allows the government to revoke publishing licenses at any time.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Most coverage of local and national news in the state press is little more than the equivalent of government press releases, typically reporting on less-than-riveting topics such as the names of all the officials who attended the inauguration of a new bridge. Opinion pieces invariably reflect conservative positions that seem decades behind the times.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Aware of its vulnerability, the English-language state paper, the New Light of Myanmar, is seeking a joint venture partner to help with a makeover.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The entry of the ruling Union Solidarity and Development Party, called the Union Daily, plans to make use of its strong financial base. The pro-military party, which holds a strong majority in parliament, is backed by many tycoons. Chief editor Win Tin said the paper will be distributed free of charge for the first 10 days beginning Monday.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We are financially strong and we have many experienced people,” he said, adding that the party will have its own separate propaganda sheet and that the newspaper will not be a mouthpiece for it.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Strong competition will come from savvy big media groups who say they will launch later.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We need more time for preparation. It is quite challenging for the reporters to switch from weeklies to dailies,” said Nyein Nyein Naing, executive editor of the 7-Day weekly news journal.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We need more time for preparation and we have to have test runs before we start the daily edition,” said Dr Than Htut Aung, CEO of the popular Eleven media group, which plans to launch The Daily Eleven on May 3.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I will print my first daily edition on May 3, Press Freedom Day, because it is very symbolic,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miYrKGRZK6zwMico55nYWd9dYKPbGamsZGjuqK%2BjKycnqtdp7K1wdGnZKmqmauutbHLsmSor56asW6wwKKjsmWemsS0vMCpnKur</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kelly-ripa-husband-mark-consuelos-son-michael-end-of-era-during-vacation.html><span>←</span><span>Kelly Ripa's husband Mark Consuelos and son Michael deal with emotional end of an era during family</span></a>
