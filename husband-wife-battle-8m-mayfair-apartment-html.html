A prominent lawyer who gave his wife a number of multi-million pound luxury homes has been criticised for trying to 'take them back' when they divorced.
Essam al-Tamimi, 55, gifted his wife Rouzin al-Charmaa, 35, the £7.8million Mayfair property next to the Saudi Arabian embassy, a smaller neighbouring property, and a £2 million Marylebone flat.
The Royal Court in Jersey heard the lawyer - who runs the largest legal firm in the Middle East - gifted his wife the properties 'as a reward for being a faithful wife'."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
