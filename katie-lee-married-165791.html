I just took a moment and stood there and looked at him and soaked it in. I was just so happy.”</p><p>Like most weddings, after the lovely ceremony came the eating and dancing! “We wanted a big feast because we both love to eat so much. It was like one big dinner party,” Katie shared, before joking, “They say no carb left behind — that’s been the theme of the weekend!”</p><p>However, the day almost didn’t go as planned for Katie, Ryan, and their family and friends. “There were thunder clouds, and it started raining as soon as we finished our hikes,” the 36-year-old shared. “And I was kind of freaked out because our wedding was outside.”</p><p>Luckily for them, it cleared up mid-day, and everyone had a blast. “Everybody, including all of the staff here, was on the dance floor singing and dancing,” Katie explained. “It was so hot and humid from the rain earlier in the day, everyone just kind of let loose and didn’t care how sweaty they got. It was one of those moments that you always remember in your life.”</p><p>The best part of the night? “Everybody ate pasta and then we all put on our swimsuits and jumped in the ocean at 1:00 in the morning. It was really, really fun!” We wish we were there!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46kmK2hlWK5prGMppirqpmasW59lW5ucmlf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ice-nine-kills-to-headline-siriusxm-octane-presents-the-octane-accelerator-tour.html><span>←</span><span>Ice Nine Kills To Headline SiriusXM Octane Presents The Octane Accelerator Tour</span></a>
