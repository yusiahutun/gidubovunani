This anxiety-inducing experience is more common than one might think — factors such as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>stress</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>postpartum hair loss</a>, genetics, and lifestyle choices can all contribute to a thinning scalp. Luckily, there are <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">affordable haircare options</a> to help reverse the damage and bring brittle hair back to a healthy, voluminous state.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Boldify 3X Biotin Hair Thickening Serum</a> is a prime example; the 3-in-1 product acts as a long-term hair growth treatment, a volumizing serum, and a leave-in conditioner. From the very first application, users noticed an immediate difference in the thickness of their strands; one reviewer reported that their hair retained fullness for three days straight after using the serum. Even <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">those who've lost massive amounts of hair</a> claim the serum has made their "thin, straw hair look thicker [and] shinier," and the photo evidence shared by some truly prove the "amazing transformations" the serum can provide (see <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">here</a>, <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">here</a>, and <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=5 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">here</a>).</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now: </strong>$23 (Originally $25); <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">amazon.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though biotin acts as the key ingredient in the formula for inciting hair growth, coconut oil and lemongrass extract play an important role in improving the overall scalp health. "Both coconut oil and lemongrass extract are used by many patients to improve hair health," says Andrew Kashian, Founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Solve Clinics</a>, an award-winning hair transplant clinic based in Chicago. "Many patients report healthier, shinier hair after using these types of natural oil as a topical treatment," he says. "They can moisturize and hydrate the scalp as well, which creates a good, nutrient rich environment for hair growth."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And the results are in: The hair growth serum has earned over 5,000 five-star ratings from Amazon shoppers who've deemed it the "<a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">hope for hopeless hair</a>." Even those with brittle hair that resembles a "<a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">haystack</a>" claim the non-sticky, non-greasy formula is an absolute game changer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"At long, long, last I have found something that truly gives volume to my thinning hair," wrote one reviewer. "I used this product once, and will never use anything else. The front top of my hair is thinning so much from thyroid disease I was ready to buy a hair piece to cover it up, but I can put that off for now. After using this product ONCE, applied only on the top for volume, the results are truly amazing. I have volume, and the thinning is less noticeable."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another person wrote: "My hair looks like one of those toddlers whose mothers desperately try to make a ponytail or anything because there isn't really much there. This product gives me SUCH great volume. The added perk? I have very greasy hair and this product lets me go two days without washing. I've NEVER done that before."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Your own transformation awaits.
