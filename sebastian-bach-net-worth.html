Sebastian made his Broadway acting debut with the title role in "Jekyll & Hyde" in April 2000, and he played <a href=# title="Riff Raff Net Worth">Riff Raff</a> in "The Rocky Horror Show" in 2001.

He is the eldest child of David Bierk and Kathleen Mae Hunter. David was an award-winning artist who painted the covers of a Bach solo album and a Skid Row album, and between his marriage to Kathleen and his second marriage to Elizabeth Lovett Aimers, he had eight children, including hockey player Zac Bierk and actress Dylan Bierk. Sebastian grew up in Peterborough, Ontario, and at age 8, he began singing in the All Saints' Anglican Church choir, which toured around Ontario and the U.S. When Bach was 14, he auditioned for the band Kid Wikkid and was hired by the band's leader, Jason Delorme. Since the band was based in Toronto, Sebastian's father eventually agreed to let him live with his aunt so he would be able to pursue his dream of becoming a rock star.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Skid Row formed in the mid-'80s, and after lead vocalist Matt Fallon left the band in 1987, <a href=# title="Jon Bon Jovi Net Worth">Jon Bon Jovi</a>'s parents, who saw Bach sing at the wedding of rock photographer Mark Weiss, suggested that Sebastian contact Jon's friend <a href=# title="Dave Sabo Net Worth">Dave Sabo</a>, who was Skid Row's guitarist. Bach flew to New Jersey to try out for the band and was hired as their new lead vocalist. Skid Row released their self-titled debut album in 1989, and it went 5x Platinum and reached #6 on the "Billboard" 200 chart. Their follow-up, 1991's "Slave to the Grind," hit #1 on the "Billboard" 200, and in 1990, they released the video album "Oh Say Can You Scream," which was certified Platinum. In 1993, Sebastian briefly toured with the band Triumph, and Skid Row released the album "Subhuman Race" in 1995. In 1996, Bach left Skid Row, reportedly after bandmate <a href=# title="Rachel Bolan Net Worth">Rachel Bolan</a> turned down a gig as the opening act on the Kiss reunion tour after Sebastian had already agreed to do it.</p><p>After leaving the group, Bach formed the band The Last Hard Men with Frogs guitarist Jimmy Flemion, Smashing Pumpkins drummer <a href=# title="Jimmy Chamberlin Net Worth">Jimmy Chamberlin</a>, and Breeders lead guitarist Kelley Deal, and in 1998, the band released a self-titled album on Nice Records after Atlantic Records decided not to release it. Sebastian released the live solo album "Bring 'Em Bach Alive!" in 1999, followed by the studio albums "Angel Down" (2007), "Kicking & Screaming" (2011), and "Give 'Em Hell" (2014). In 2000, he played the lead in "Jekyll & Hyde" on Broadway, then starred as Riff Raff in "The Rocky Horror Show" in 2001 and Jesus in "Jesus Christ Superstar" from 2002 to 2003.

Sebastian proposed to Suzanne Le two months after they began dating, and they married on August 26, 2015.</p><p>In July 2017, Bach underwent hernia surgery that was "singing related. He wrote on social media, "After years of doing what I do, rock 'n' roll has taken a toll on a part of my body, and tomorrow I am going to get it fixed." Sebastian later told "Loud" magazine, "I had a hernia from screaming my guts outâ€¦I definitely think, well, I know, that's it's from screaming on stage for all those years because I have to contort my body into weird positions." Bach has fired off numerous angry tweets about <a href=# title="Donald Trump Net Worth">Donald Trump</a>, such as "Our reality TV show host leader is a petulant little baby who doesn't believe in science when it's science and science only that will get us out of this science fiction novel. He is killing us." In a 2018 interview, he revealed that he had voted for <a href=# title="Hillary Clinton Net Worth">Hillary Clinton</a> in the 2016 presidential election, stating, "I don't understand how anybody would accept a reality show host as president instead of a politician. It's insanity."</p><h2 id=awards-nominations><strong>Awards and Nominations</strong></h2><p>In 1990, Skid Row won an American Music Award for Favorite Heavy Metal/Hard Rock New Artist and earned a nomination for Favorite Heavy Metal/Hard Rock Album for their self-titled debut.
