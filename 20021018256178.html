Russell didn’t come. He called me and said, ‘Oh, I hear I was on the set the other day.’ But he didn’t come.”</p><p id=ebzsyDASjLV data-wc=87>Fellow Icon winner Julianne Moore – who received an Oscar nomination for her daring role in porn-themed drama <i>Boogie Nights</i> – joked about the significance of big screen nude scenes as she accepted her gong. “If you want a career that’s important, there are things you need to do,” she quipped tongue-in-cheek. “Be persistent, diligent and take off your clothes.” Declaring herself a “serious actress” just doing her job, Julianne joked that she would have flashed some flesh at the luncheon, but “you have already seen it”.</p><p id=eIwFaAzbR6G data-wc=63>Nicole – who shares the screen with Julianne and Meryl in the soon-to-be-released <i>The Hours</i> – showed her own sense of humour, arguing that some of her risque roles showed she’s also a serious actress. “I’ve appeared naked in many of my films and I’ve even appeared naked on stage eight times a week (in <i>The Blue Room</i>),” she said. “So I qualify!”</p><p id=eLvgM-6TldSp data-wc=21>Other stars at the Beverly Hills event included <i>X-Files</i> actor David Duchovny and actresses Chloe Sevigny, Selma Blair and Carrie-Ann Moss.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/legacy/celebrities/2002/10/18/women-lunch/imgs/luncheon-dop1a.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/legacy/celebrities/2002/10/18/women-lunch/imgs/luncheon-dop2a.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2hlah8c3yPa2hpaWhngnd9lnFmsKedmrtuuNSnmqFn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kevin-costner-yellowstone-season-5-update.html><span>←</span><span>Kevin Costner Doesn't 'Anticipate' Being on Location in 2023</span></a>
