I was lucky enough to wear some of his designs, and the night was such a great tribute to him. This is one of Stella’s gowns that have real wow factor. I paired it with Fred Leighton jewelry and super-high nude satin Louboutin platforms. The height of the shoe was empowering and flattering, which is necessary with such a high slit! I kept the shoes and rediscovered them years later when I was packing up my place in New York.</p><h2 class="css-kr21rx eutn2uj7">Gucci</h2><img alt="Clothing, Cocktail dress, Dress, Fashion model, Shoulder, Little black dress, Footwear, Fashion, Hairstyle, Joint, " data-cy=slide-image-2 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-gwyneth-paltrow-06-1506980805.jpg title="Clothing, Cocktail dress, Dress, Fashion model, Shoulder, Little black dress, Footwear, Fashion, Hairstyle, Joint, " width=1604 height=2848 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">GEORGE PIMENTAL/WIREIMAGE</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This night was magical. I’m wearing Gucci, and my stylist helped me put this look together for last year’s Art + Film Gala at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. It was an event honoring the artist Robert Irwin and the filmmaker Kathryn Bigelow. The museum is wildly inspiring for us L.A. residents, and I love taking my kids there for a cultural experience. I had also just been named CEO of my company, Goop, by our board, and stepping into that role was a major professional milestone for me. As for the dress, it was so unique—short, sexy, with an incredible neckline and sleeves. Gucci creative director Alessandro Michele is such a genius. These gold strappy heels were just the right complement.</p><h2 class="css-kr21rx eutn2uj7">Christian Louboutin</h2><img alt="Clothing, Cocktail dress, Dress, Fashion model, Shoulder, Pink, Red carpet, Fashion, Carpet, Premiere, " data-cy=slide-image-3 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-gwyneth-paltrow-03-1506980804.jpg title="Clothing, Cocktail dress, Dress, Fashion model, Shoulder, Pink, Red carpet, Fashion, Carpet, Premiere, " width=1729 height=2894 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Mike Marsland/WIREIMAGE</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Bubblegum-pink suede shoes with a pink Prada dress to match! This was a total Elizabeth Saltzman moment—she’s my stylist. I was at the National Movie Awards in London in 2010, and I’m sure that her dream was for me to look like a mix of Park Avenue lady and Catherine Deneuve: the bouffant, the eyeliner, the classic silhouette. And clearly she succeeded. I definitely held on to these Louboutins—they’re the perfect shade of pink. I have a storage area where I save a lot of the shoes I’ve worn to major events like the Grammys and the Oscars. I couldn’t even begin to tell you how many pairs I have.</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><h2 class="css-kr21rx eutn2uj7">Christian Louboutin</h2><img alt="Leg, Thigh, Little black dress, Blond, Fashion, Cocktail dress, Sitting, Dress, Human leg, Nightclub, " data-cy=slide-image-4 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-gwyneth-paltrow-04-1506980805.jpg title="Leg, Thigh, Little black dress, Blond, Fashion, Cocktail dress, Sitting, Dress, Human leg, Nightclub, " width=1984 height=3000 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">KEVIN MAZUR/WIREIMAGE</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Here I am with my great friend Beyoncé at the 2011 Grammy Awards, around the time that I was guest-starring on The version of “Forget You” that I sang on the show had become a hit, and I had just performed it onstage with Cee Lo Green. Beyoncé played a huge part in helping me get through that performance alive, and you can see by my smile how relieved I was that I hadn’t totally embarrassed myself. After I sang I went back to watch Arcade Fire play, and they won Album of the Year, which was really cool. I’m wearing a sheer black Monique Lhuillier minidress with these Christian Louboutin architectural heels. Oh, man, I wish I still had them. Alas, they were loaners.</p><h2 class="css-kr21rx eutn2uj7">Dsquared2</h2><img alt="Clothing, Dress, Hair, Cocktail dress, Black, Blond, Fashion model, Little black dress, Leg, Fashion, " data-cy=slide-image-5 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-gwyneth-paltrow-02-1506980805.jpg title="Clothing, Dress, Hair, Cocktail dress, Black, Blond, Fashion model, Little black dress, Leg, Fashion, " width=1801 height=2957 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">ELISABETTA VILLA / GETTY IMAGES</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">These Dsquared2 platforms marked the beginning of a long statement-shoe phase in my life. It was 2008, and I was just starting to venture out again into the public eye after having been home with my kids for a couple of years. I’m at a press conference in Rome for with Robert Downey Jr., who is one of my favorite people, and the rest of the cast, and there were interviews, photo calls, and all the rest. I’m wearing a black Preen minidress, which seemed like an interesting choice for day at the time. I remember getting compliments on the shoes, which I archived. I try to hold on to everything so I can give them to my daughter, Apple, someday.</p><h2 class="css-kr21rx eutn2uj7">Christian Louboutin</h2><img alt="Red carpet, Fashion model, Dress, Clothing, Carpet, Gown, Flooring, Fashion, Premiere, Long hair, " data-cy=slide-image-6 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-gwyneth-paltrow-05-1506980804.jpg title="Red carpet, Fashion model, Dress, Clothing, Carpet, Gown, Flooring, Fashion, Premiere, Long hair, " width=1848 height=2755 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">PAUL FENTON/ZUMA PRESS, INC./ALAMY STOCK PHOTO</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This was at a post- Oscars party after I performed a song called “Coming Home” at the Academy Awards in 2011. I was a wreck—it was the most nervous I’d ever been about performing in my life. My body wasn’t responding to my brain; I literally didn’t know how to walk from point A to point B. So before I went onstage, I chased three beta-blockers with a beer, which was way too extreme because I couldn’t feel my hands. I recall being so happy to be done with the performance portion that I couldn’t wait to get inside and have a drink with a bunch of my girlfriends. I wore a Michael Kors gown, a Jimmy Choo clutch, Forevermark earrings, and Christian Louboutin shoes—sparkly with a slight platform and pointy toes, and perfect with the dress.</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfm660tMiopWirpKeypsCMrKuypJVktHJ%2Blm9vamxpZLS4xc2eq6FloJa5tb7OsGSsoJ%2BaerSxwqucratf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./10000-maniacs-postpones-multiple-upcoming-shows-including-summerfest.html><span>←</span><span>10,000 Maniacs Postpones Multiple Upcoming Shows, Including Summerfest</span></a>
