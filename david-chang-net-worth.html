Chang expanded his influence to Sydney, Australia, where he opened his first restaurant outside the USA. It is the Momofuku Seiōbo restaurant, located in the City Star Casino in Sydney.</p><p>In 2012 he decided to open a restaurant in Toronto, which expanded to a total of five restaurants, which also increased his net worth as had those in the USA.</p><p>In adding to his net worth, Chang has also been recognized as a TV personality due to his culinary success. In recent years, he has been a judge in several TV reality shows including the “Top Chef: All Stars” and “MasterChef Australia”. David has also launched his own TV show entitled “The Mind of a Chef”, which has been airing on PBS since 2012, alongside <a href=#>Anthony Bourdain</a>.</p><p>Over the course of his career, Chang has won numerous prestigious awards.
