How do you win over a girl who rejected you?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c080f0700572d346.jpg><p class=align-left>Many men perceive rejection as a downfall and downgrading experience. Thus, they try to prove their worth by winning the girl of their dreams back. Although not everything will be as you want in life, there are ways you can increase the chances of you winning her over again. Here are some of the best tips you can use to win over a girl.</p><h2>1.Try to move on by getting your mind off the rejection</h2><p class=align-left>Moving on after being rejected by a girl might sometimes feel like climbing a vertical shaft with no stairs. However, it's the proper way to make your mind grow and live a happy life once more. Furthermore, you were someone before you guys met.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e6f35eb1f4c77208.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ cutest good morning paragraphs for her to wake up to</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Am I the reason the girl rejected me? Why me? These questions might pop up daily. Engage yourself in different activities, which make you happy. It may be playing a soccer game, cooking with a friend or just hanging out so long as they take your mind off the depression. Once you can get over the entire feeling of rejection, you will be able to re-strategize and go back with a stronger game.</p><h2>2. Don't show any motives of hunting her</h2><p class=align-left>She has already said 'no' or 'not now', and this answer might as well not have changed by now. Girls love attention when it matters. Give her space to do her things. She probably has her friends and things to do apart from acknowledging your presence.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>How to Approach a Girl in Kenya: Moves That Will Earn You Your Dream</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e6f35eb1f4c77208.jpg><h2>3.
