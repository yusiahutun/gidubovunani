"We’re really enjoying the moment, adventuring around the world and having fun. We’ll let you know!"</p><p>The 19-year-old certainly is plenty busy — she currently works at the Australia Zoo, but also frequently travels the world saving endangered animals just like her late father, Crocodile Hunter star <a href=#>Steve Irwin</a>, who died after a stingray attack in 2006. And of course Chandler, 21, is right there with her through it all. "It’s wonderful to have found someone who’s up for any challenge, from working with crocodiles to making echidna [spiny anteater] food — which is made from squished insects, by the way," she gushed.</p><p>The longtime couple really couldn't get any sweeter. "He’s my sunshine everyday," Bindi said to Life & Style. "Chandler isn’t just my boyfriend, but also my best friend. He is always there and ready to help. [We] try to stick together as best as we can. Whenever we travel, we always try<br>to travel together. It’s nice knowing you have someone with you who is always on your side." So adorable!</p><p>Although her dad never got the chance to meet Chandler, Bindi believes Steve would have most definitely approved of the former American pro wakeboarder. "I’m lucky I have found the one, the person I want to spend all my time with," Bindi <a href=#>once said in an interview</a>. "Mum [<a href=#>Terri Irwin</a>] and Robert and I have talked about that a lot. We all think dad would have loved Chandler. I believe there’s always someone for everyone and when you find that one, as we have found each other, it’s a real blessing and a privilege."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46boKecmWK2s8PIp2ScoJGjsa2x0WanqK%2BVoblusc2gmKCdlGJ%2BdYWYbm1o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./20-unbelievable-facts-about-alec-puro.html><span>←</span><span>20 Unbelievable Facts About Alec Puro</span></a>
