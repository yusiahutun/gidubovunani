The video, obtained by <a href=#>TMZ</a>, is from an apartment complex in North Hollywood where Saweetie was reportedly renting last year. It shows the “<a href=#>Best Friend</a>” rapper, legal name Diamonté Harper, swinging at Quavo, legal name Quavious Marshall, as she tries to remove luggage from the elevator. Quavo then pushes her into the elevator and uses his body to prevent her from exiting with the luggage until she ends up on the ground, just out of frame. Quavo stays in the elevator, glancing at her. When the door opens, he gets out, and Saweetie slowly follows, limping. The incident allegedly took place in 2020, TMZ confirmed with sources on both sides.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckmwefzqw00203g6fn8bv3kxq@published data-word-count=81>Saweetie was the first to <a href=#>announce their breakup</a> earlier this month amid cheating rumors. “I’ve endured too much betrayal and hurt behind the scenes for a false narrative to be circulating that degrades my character,” she wrote on Twitter at the time. “Presents don’t band aid scars and the love isn’t real when the intimacy is given to other women.” That same day, the Daily Mail <a href=#>reported</a> that Quavo had repossessed the Bentley he leased for Saweetie as a Christmas gift.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckmywicuf000q3g6f8qh7sl6r@published data-word-count=63><strong>Update, Thursday, April 1, at 9:15 a.m.: </strong>The Los Angeles Police Department has opened an investigation into the elevator incident, <a href=#>TMZ reports</a>. According to their law-enforcement sources, detectives have seen the video and want to discuss it with both parties, separately, to determine if the situation could be considered domestic violence. Neither rapper has addressed the footage since it surfaced on March 30.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckmzai1jy000p3g6fobsjc0ck@published data-word-count=68><strong>Update, Thursday, April 1, at 3:47 p.m.: </strong>Saweetie has broken her silence on the tape, issuing a statement to TMZ. She said, “This unfortunate incident happened a year ago, while we have reconciled since then and moved past this particular disagreement, there were simply too many other hurdles to overcome in our relationship and we have both since moved on.” Quavo has yet to publicly address the tape.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckmzpd45b000r3h66bv2m9slg@published data-word-count=56><strong>Update, Thursday, April 1, at 10:32 p.m.: </strong>Quavo has spoken out about the tape, denying that he ever physically abused Saweetie. “We had an unfortunate situation almost a year ago that we both learned and moved on from,” he told <a href=#>TMZ</a>. “I haven’t physically abused Saweetie and have real gratitude for what we did share overall.”</p><h2 class=sources>Sources</h2><a class=source-link-title href=#><span>tmz</span> <span class=svg-wrapper></span></a><a class=source-link-title href=#><span>tmz</span> <span class=svg-wrapper></span></a><h2 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h2><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/ckmgoe3h000006cn9mbgodcei@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Saweetie Says She’s Single After Unfollowing Quavo on Instagram</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Quavo Pushes Saweetie in Leaked Elevator Footage From 2020</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlpamdgaXyywcCvpmaopai1pr%2BMrJiwnZWptqZ5xKWcr5mkpL9uwsidnKhllqe8rnmRaWlpZpipuq0%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./millionaire-gymnast-olivia-dunne-shares-29805307.html><span>←</span><span>Millionaire gymnast Olivia Dunne shares stance on relationships in 'wishing well' post</span></a>
