He was initially drafted by the Arizona Cardinals in 2018 as an undrafted free agent before officially joining the Texans in 2020.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Jonathan-Owens-NFL.webp alt="Jonathan Owens, NFL" width=640 height=481 data-sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jonathan_Owens_Early_Life></span>Jonathan Owens’ Early Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Owens, who was born on July 22, 1995, received guidance from his mother Arthurine Cannon to become an NFL player. He acknowledges his mother’s efforts and is a family-oriented person with a sister. Despite facing challenges, Owens persevered as a safety.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Education_Career></span>Education & Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Initially, the player’s career took a downward turn due to the lack of Division I scholarships available to him while he was studying at Christian Brothers College High School in suburban St. Louis. However, he eventually pursued his education at Missouri Western State, a Division II school.</p><p>The NFL scouts were taken aback by his abilities when they visited his college. His 43-inch vertical at the NFL combine far surpassed that of most other athletes.</p><p>However, despite not being selected in the draft, <a href=# rel=noopener>Jonathan Owens</a> was later signed by the Arizona Cardinals. Unfortunately, this signing did not pay off for the team as he spent most of his time on the sidelines due to a knee injury.</p><p>After struggling with a series of injuries, the Cardinals decided to terminate his contract. As a result, he began training at a local park, which greatly humbled him and inspired him to improve.</p><p>Following a series of knee surgeries, Jonathan Owens only appeared in one game in 2019 but managed to play six games in 2020. Despite facing challenges, he eventually earned a spot on the active roster and made his first appearance for the <a href=# rel=noopener>Houston Texans</a> in their game against the Jacksonville Jaguars.</p><p>He joined the Houston Texas practice squad in September and was later moved up to the active roster by the team in November 2019. This led to his first-ever interception during a game against the Los Angeles Chargers.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/NFL-Jonathan-Owens.webp alt="NFL, Jonathan Owens" width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>According to his official player biography, he joined the team in 2020 and then went on to become a free agent a couple of years later. In May 2023, he signed with the Packers.</p><p>The major career change occurred only a month following the wedding of Simone and Jonathan. For years, the couple has shown unwavering support for each other, both publicly and privately.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Personal_Life></span>Personal Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In 2020, <a href=# rel=noopener>Simone Biles</a> and Jonathan Owens gained widespread attention on the Internet after she shared a birthday message for him, which has since been removed. The post included a photo of him carrying her on his back in July.</p><p>After a couple of weeks, they officially announced their relationship by sharing a photo on Simone’s social media with the words, “It’s just us.”</p><p>Since Simone and Jonathan made their relationship official on Instagram a few days before the start of the 2020 NFL pre-season, it can be assumed that she had attended previous Texans games before the one she shared about in October.</p><p>In February 2022, Jonathan Owens asked the big question and Simone shared the exciting announcement on Instagram, showcasing a close-up video of her beautiful ring.</p><p>At the end of April, Simone revealed a small surprise to the public: She and Jonathan tied the knot in a courthouse ceremony in Texas. As it turns out, their courthouse wedding was simply a means to become officially married before their planned wedding in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Jonathan-Owens-Simone-Biles.webp alt="Jonathan Owens, Simone Biles" width=750 height=500 data-sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Net_Worth></span>Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>At just 28 years old, Jonathan Owens’ net worth is estimated at $7 million, though some sources claim it may be as high as $50 million.</p><p>In 2020, he inked a two-year deal with the Texans worth $1,390,000, with an annual salary of $695,000 and a base salary of $780,000. Currently, there is no information available on any endorsement deals he may have signed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbXPraarp16YvK57z2icsaicpL%2BqusZmoaimkam1orqMqK6epqNixKq3yGaYoJ1dl7awec2fo2abkaeypr6MsKCfnV2otq67zZ5km6GcmsBuusStZLCnoqm1cA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fexploring-jonathan-owens-wiki-age-bio-nfl-career-wife-simone-biles-net-worth.html&text=Age%2c%20Bio%2c%20NFL%20Career%2c%20Wife%20Simone%20Biles%2c%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fexploring-jonathan-owens-wiki-age-bio-nfl-career-wife-simone-biles-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fexploring-jonathan-owens-wiki-age-bio-nfl-career-wife-simone-biles-net-worth.html&title=Age%2c%20Bio%2c%20NFL%20Career%2c%20Wife%20Simone%20Biles%2c%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fexploring-jonathan-owens-wiki-age-bio-nfl-career-wife-simone-biles-net-worth.html&title=Age%2c%20Bio%2c%20NFL%20Career%2c%20Wife%20Simone%20Biles%2c%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fexploring-jonathan-owens-wiki-age-bio-nfl-career-wife-simone-biles-net-worth.html&title=Age%2c%20Bio%2c%20NFL%20Career%2c%20Wife%20Simone%20Biles%2c%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fexploring-jonathan-owens-wiki-age-bio-nfl-career-wife-simone-biles-net-worth.html&description=Age%2c%20Bio%2c%20NFL%20Career%2c%20Wife%20Simone%20Biles%2c%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./helen-hunt-plastic-surgery-and-face-transformation.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Helen Hunt Plastic Surgery and Face Transformation">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./aaron-tredwell.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Aaron Tredwell Janet Mock Husband Partner Wiki, Age, Bio, Photos">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
