Especially now, with the Hardy album [The Mockingbird & the Crow, a half country, half rock project]," he says. "I love it, because yeah, if you do take a step back and look at it, it does look like we're the three amigos. But we are so different."</p><p>One thing they've got in common, though, is that all three men's careers are rooted in prolific songwriting. Ernest is a writer on all 24 tracks on the deluxe version of Flower Shops. Hardy had a hand in creating every song on The Mockingbird & the Crow, which consists of 17 tracks. Comparatively, Wallen wrote a mere 14 of the 36 songs on One Thing at a Time.</p><p>But much like Ernest and Hardy, Wallen counts his songwriting skills as a big part of his rise to fame: Early on, he co-wrote No. 1 hits like <a href=#>Jason Aldean</a>'s "You Make it Easy" and <a href=#>Florida Georgia Line</a>'s "Up Down" as he launched into an artist career of his own.</p><p>Now, the three singer-songwriters are at the forefront of a new movement within country music, which isn't afraid to borrow stylistic cues from other genres, but always keeps sharp, fresh songwriting front and center. It's a formula that works: Songs recorded or written by these three artists are some of the most commonly-played hits on country radio.</p><p>"The one thing that is a common theme among us is that we like to write songs. And the songs that we write happen to resonate at this point in time," Ernest sums up. "I'm thankful. I don't know why, but it's happening, so we'll keep writing until that's not the case."</p><p>When it comes to genre-blending country, Ernest goes on to say that he's continuously inspired by his friends. "I love, love, love that I can rock out to a Hardy record as hard as I would rock out to — I mean, yeah, it's rock," he says. "... I texted him whenever it came out and said, 'I admire you for being able to push this genre ... you really pull [off] rock and not half-a--ing rock, also not half-a--ing country and not sacrificing the integrity of the song."</p><p>Wallen has frequently taken cues from the hip hop genre in his country, and he's hinted that One Thing at a Time will continue in that direction. Ernest — whose Flower Shops is a master class in traditional, solid-gold heartbreak country — says that if he were to put out a dual-genre album like Hardy did, he might lean in the hip hop direction, too.</p><p>"If I ever did that, then my back half would be rap," he states. "Straight rap. I would go from the most traditional country to banging-a-- rap songs."</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>The 30 Best Country Rap Songs of All Time, Ranked</h2><p>"Old Town Road" is just the tip of the iceberg.
