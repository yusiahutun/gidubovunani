I ask forgiveness for all their mistakes. Who doesn’t make mistakes?”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The film ends with a card that carefully acknowledges the company’s current leadership, and also notes that it currently has an estimated value of US$60 billion – far beyond the scale of the company during the time depicted in the story.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yet House of Gucci can only strive to capture the larger-than-life aspects of the Gucci family and those in their circle.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Patrizia Reggiani</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/12/03/f1eed1e6-64b5-4b7a-974a-4b77260af756_80996ee0.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When Reggiani and Maurizio were together, the Italian press dubbed her “the Joan Collins of Monte Napoleone”, referring to an upscale shopping street in Milan. But during the trial, she would become “The Black Widow”. She would also sometimes be referred to in the press as “Lady Gucci” – a prescient irony for the woman who would later be portrayed on screen by Lady Gaga. Sentenced to 29 years in prison for orchestrating her ex-husband’s murder, she was released in 2016 after serving 18 years. She could have been released even earlier, but she turned down a work-release programme, reportedly saying, “I never worked a day in my life, and I don’t intend to start now.”</p>In the years since her release, Reggiani seemingly can’t help but find her way back into the spotlight. Asked by paparazzi in the street why she hired a gunman to kill Maurizio rather than do it herself, she said, “My eyesight is not so good, I didn’t want to miss.” According to the new afterword in the movie tie-in edition of Forden’s book, in November 2020, Reggiani prevailed in a case before Italy’s Supreme Court in which her <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">two daughters, Alessandra and Allegra</span></a>, were attempting to block her continuing to receive a substantial annuity from the Gucci estate. In 2014, she said, “I still feel like a Gucci – in fact, the most Gucci of them all.” She also recently expressed dismay to the Italian press over the fact that Lady Gaga had not reached out to speak to her before filming.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Maurizio Gucci</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/12/03/c8a0902b-e177-4862-a7d2-63f8435101a0_80996ee0.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Maurizio would go from reluctantly joining his family firm to ruthlessly ousting his relatives to enact the vision he was convinced would save the company. His lavish spending and lacklustre management left the company in a precipitous position when he finally relinquished control.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In Forden’s book, as Maurizio rises in the company, his own father Rodolfo tells Reggiani, “Once he gets money and power, he will change.” Those words would prove prophetic, as Maurizio would ultimately manoeuvre his own family members from the company. He and Reggiani split in 1985, when he supposedly packed a bag and had a friend tell her the next day that he wasn’t coming back.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 1993, after Maurizio sold his 50 per cent interest in Gucci to the same investment firm he had brought in to buy up his relatives’ shares, there would no longer be anyone from the Gucci family involved in running Gucci. He was murdered on the steps of his office building in Milan on March 27, 1995.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Camila Cabello is selling the love nest she shared with Shawn Mendes</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Aldo Gucci</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/12/03/8a2602c8-fbfa-4630-a83c-cb233acdbb20_80996ee0.jpg>The oldest son of company founder Guccio, it was Aldo who oversaw the brand’s rise to international heights, becoming a status symbol of wealth and luxury. Aldo wove a complex web of companies, subsidiaries and franchises to license out the Gucci name for other products <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">besides its signature leather goods</span></a>, creating a vast engine for profits. With the authorities tipped off by his own son Paolo, Aldo was sentenced to one year and one day for tax evasion in an American prison in 1986 at the age of 81. In 1989, he sold his shares in Gucci and died one year later.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Paolo Gucci</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/12/03/b285c8ff-6071-4ed9-8b06-6e1bac20015e_80996ee0.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Long wanting to be a designer himself, Paolo endlessly fought to use his own name on products, attempting to leverage the Gucci branding for his own ends.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">His father, Aldo, had given 10 per cent of his 50 per cent stake in the company to his three sons, allocating 3.3 per cent to each of them. When Paolo aligned his interest with Maurizio’s 50 per cent, he tipped the scales to begin the process that ultimately led to the family no longer owning the company. He filed for bankruptcy in 1993 and died in London in 1995.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Speaking on Leto’s depiction of her father, Paolo’s daughter Patrizia was quoted as saying, “Horrible, horrible.

His wife, actress Alessandra Winkelhausen Gucci, died at age 44 in 1954 when their son Maurizio was only five years old. Rodolfo never remarried and doted on Maurizio throughout the rest of his childhood. (Maurizio was named after Rodolfo’s screen name, Maurizio D’Ancora,) Toward the end of his life, as he battled cancer, Rodolfo would premiere Il Cinema Nella Mia Vita, or The Film of My Life, in part a documentary about his own life and in part a plea to Maurizio to safeguard the family legacy.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Maurizio was acquitted of tax evasion after he was charged with forging his father’s signature on the stock certificates that transferred Rodolfo’s shares of Gucci to him following Rodolfo’s death in 1983. While the movie only implies that Reggiani forged the signatures, a long-time assistant to Rodolfo testified that she in fact committed the act.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Paola Franchi</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/12/03/f9ffb29e-c30b-4236-8e89-8605c2e01e90_80996ee0.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tall, thin, blond and comfortable in the world of the wealthy – seemingly the opposite in every way of Reggiani – Paola Franchi was Maurizio’s girlfriend during the last years of his life and was living with him at his vast palazzo on Milan’s luxurious Corso Venezia at the time of his death. Her son, Charly, who was also living there, is not included in the film. Maurizio and Paola had known each other briefly as teenagers, meeting on the beaches of Santa Margherita, and began their relationship after reuniting in 1990 at a nightclub in St. Moritz. Reggiani had Paola thrown out the day after Maurizio was murdered, filing papers with the court mere hours after the shooting. A 2016 article in The Guardian reported that Franchi split her time between Milan and Kenya.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Pina Auriemma</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/12/03/50f3641e-2fd3-4b40-b91f-dfbae5757bc8_80996ee0.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the movie, Reggiani calls psychic Pina Auriemma one night after seeing her on television. According to Forden’s book, the two actually met at a health spa in Ischia when Reggiani was there with Maurizio, and the two women became fast friends. Having been convicted for her role in securing the assassins who would kill Maurizio, Auriemma was sentenced to 25 years in prison. She was released in 2010.</p>Hayek, who plays Auriemma in House of Gucci, is <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">married to François-Henri Pinault,</span></a> CEO of Kering, the luxury group that currently owns Gucci.
