An epic movie is one that tends to be based on real events and/or real people, plays out over a runtime where an intermission often feels necessary, and has a tremendous amount of money put into production for the purpose of impressing audiences.

What follows will focus on epics that retell true stories or place fictionalized characters in historical settings. As such, sci-fi or fantasy epics are not included here (that's not intended to be a slight on the excellent <a href=#><strong>The Lord of the Rings</strong></a> trilogy, for example). <strong>Those with time to spare and a desire to be awed ought to check the following films out</strong>, and these all-time iconic epics are ranked below from great to greatest.</p><h2 id=39-gladiator-39-2000><span class=item-num>25 </span><span>'Gladiator' (2000)</span></h2><h3 id=directed-by-ridley-scott>Directed by Ridley Scott</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/russell-crowe-gladiator-1x_1-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>No one can deny that <a href=#><strong>Ridley Scott</strong> knows how to make historical epics</a>, as this kind of movie represents a significant chunk of the titles within his vast filmography. There's a strong argument to be made that <a href=#><strong>Gladiator</strong></a> - while perhaps not the most historically accurate - is Scott's overall best epic, and one of the most exciting films of its decade. It stars <strong>Russell Crowe</strong> as a Roman army general who's betrayed and forced to fight in gladiatorial combat, all the while plotting his revenge.</p><p><strong>It begins with a huge battle sequence, sets up an emotional story, and then slowly builds to a dramatic and intense climax</strong>, staging several gripping - and amazingly well-crafted - action sequences along the way. Alongside The Lord of the Rings (2001-2003), Gladiator can be seen as a movie that made epics cool again in the early 2000s, and though it's unfortunate they might have gone out of fashion once more (<a href=#>superheroes were more the rage in the 2010s</a>), at least it was fun while it lasted.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title=Gladiator>Gladiator</a></h5>R<p class=display-card-description></p><strong>Release Date</strong> <span>May 5, 2000</span> <strong>Director</strong> <span><a data-id href=#>Ridley Scott</a></span> <strong>Cast</strong> <span><a data-id href=#>Russell Crowe</a> , <a data-id href=#>Joaquin Phoenix</a> , <a data-id href=#>Connie Nielsen</a> , Oliver Reed , Richard Harris , <a data-id href=#>Derek Jacobi</a></span> <strong>Runtime</strong> <span>155 minutes</span> <strong>Main Genre</strong> <span><a data-id href=#>Action</a></span><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch on Netflix</a></span></p><h2 id=39-the-emigrants-39-1971-amp-39-the-new-land-39-1972><span class=item-num>24 </span><span>'The Emigrants' (1971) & 'The New Land' (1972)</span></h2><h3 id=directed-by-jan-troell>Directed by Jan Troell</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/the-new-land-1972.jpg><p><strong>The Emigrants</strong> and <strong>The New Land</strong> are two halves of the same story, with this duology being made as one whole epic, <a href=#>though it was released in two parts</a>, perhaps because otherwise, it would demand its audience sit in a theater for 6.5 hours (even with an intermission, that could be daunting).

It's daunting, harrowing, grisly, and very sad in parts, <strong>but it's hard not to be impressed by the scale of this two-part film</strong>, as well as the performances from much of its cast, including Swedish superstars (and frequent <strong>Ingmar Bergman</strong> collaborators) <strong>Max von Sydow</strong> and <strong>Liv Ullmann</strong>.</p><h2 id=39-spartacus-39-1960><span class=item-num>23 </span><span>'Spartacus' (1960)</span></h2><h3 id=directed-by-stanley-kubrick>Directed by Stanley Kubrick</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Spartacus-movie.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Stanley Kubrick</strong> was always an ambitious filmmaker, so it makes sense that he made a handful of genuine epics during his directorial career. <strong><a href=#>Spartacus</a> </strong>was one of the biggest films he ever made, and his first movie that ran for more than 90 minutes. However, saying that is really underselling it, because the total runtime for Spartacus dwarfs the runtime of the four feature films Kubrick made in the 1950s, given this 1960 epic runs for a staggering 197 minutes.</p><p>Spartacus uses this runtime well, telling <a href=#>an expansive and action-packed historical story</a> about a slave who leads an uprising, building a progressively larger army as he goes and proving himself a threat to those in Rome who held power back in the first century BC. <strong>Kirk Douglas</strong> gives one of his most memorable performances in the lead role here, the supporting cast - including <strong>Laurence Olivier</strong>, <strong>Charles Laughton</strong>, and <strong>Tony Curtis</strong> - impresses, <strong>and the battle scenes hold up extremely well</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title=Spartacus>Spartacus</a></h5>PG-13<p class=display-card-description></p><strong>Release Date</strong> <span>October 6, 1960</span> <strong>Director</strong> <span>Stanley Kubrick , Anthony Mann</span> <strong>Cast</strong> <span><a data-id href=#>Kirk Douglas</a> , Laurence Olivier , Jean Simmons , Charles Laughton , Peter Ustinov , John Gavin , Nina Foch , John Ireland</span> <strong>Runtime</strong> <span>197 Minutes</span> <strong>Main Genre</strong> <span>Biography</span><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rent on Apple TV</a></span></p><h2 id=39-gone-with-the-wind-39-1939><span class=item-num>22 </span><span>'Gone with the Wind' (1939)</span></h2><h3 id=directed-by-victor-fleming>Directed by Victor Fleming</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Gone-With-the-Wind-(1939).jpg><p>There are many things that could be - and have been - said about <strong>Gone with the Wind</strong> in the 80+ years since its release.

Much of <a href=#>Gone with the Wind's about the troubled romance</a> between Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler, with plenty of melodrama attached, and it also plays out during - and shortly after - the American Civil War.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So it's a romance/drama/war film, and one of the earliest films that can be recognized as a classic Hollywood epic movie.

The 1910s was when the feature film format began to take shape, and many broad cinematic genres/conventions came to be formed. <strong>D.W. Griffith</strong> was a leading figure from this time responsible for the development of the artform, and though the infamous <a href=#><strong>The Birth of a Nation</strong></a> (1915) is his best-known, it's 1916's <strong>Intolerance: Love’s Struggle Throughout the Ages</strong> that's overall better and more deserving of recognition.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The latter serves as Griffith <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reflecting and commenting on some of the criticisms</a> the former got, all the while being more ambitious and impressive from a technical perspective, as well as something that feels easier to watch nowadays. Across 197 minutes, Griffith tells several thematically linked stories from throughout history, bouncing between them with ease and <strong>presenting some truly staggering sights on screen that still look gargantuan to this day</strong>. The fact Intolerance is both a long and silent film may not make it the easiest thing to sit back and casually watch, but those interested in film history should give it a shot (and prioritize it over The Birth of a Nation).</p><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Watch on Prime Video</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=39-the-human-condition-39-trilogy-1959-1961><span class=item-num>18 </span><span>'The Human Condition' Trilogy (1959-1961)</span></h2><h3 id=directed-by-masaki-kobayashi>Directed by Masaki Kobayashi</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/the-human-condition-iii_-a-soldier-s-prayer-1961.jpg><p>There are three films that make up <strong>The Human Condition</strong> trilogy, and each when taken on its own would qualify as a groundbreaking epic.

It's hard to differentiate them quality-wise, and they all add up to tell one coherent and tremendously moving story, so it's best to highlight them as one multi-part film.</p><p>The Human Condition revolves around a conscientious objector named Kaji, and the way he's <a href=#>continually challenged throughout World War II</a>.

If you can get past some occasionally imperfect de-aging effects, The Irishman is a staggering achievement from an aging yet wiser-than-ever filmmaker at the height of his directorial powers, bolstered by some all-time great performances from acting legends like <strong>Robert De Niro</strong>, <strong>Al Pacino</strong>, and <strong>Joe Pesci</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="The Irishman">The Irishman</a></h5>R<p class=display-card-description></p><strong>Release Date</strong> <span>November 27, 2019</span> <strong>Director</strong> <span>Martin Scorsese</span> <strong>Cast</strong> <span><a data-id href=#>Jesse Plemons</a> , <a data-id href=#>Robert De Niro</a> , <a data-id href=#>Anna Paquin</a> , Al Pacino , <a data-id href=#>Joe Pesci</a> , <a data-id href=#>Harvey Keitel</a></span> <strong>Runtime</strong> <span>209 minutes</span> <strong>Main Genre</strong> <span>Crime</span><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch on Netflix</a></span></p><h2 id=39-ben-hur-39-1959><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>'Ben-Hur' (1959)</span></h2><h3 id=directed-by-william-wyler>Directed by William Wyler</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/charlton-heston_ben-hur-1959.jpg><p>As demonstrated by aforementioned epics like Gone with the Wind and The Ten Commandments, Hollywood certainly knew how to go big <a href=#>during its Golden Age</a>.

Enter 1927's <a href=#><strong>Napoleon</strong></a>, which is a silent epic that runs for about 5.5 hours, which sounds like it could well be long enough to appropriately condense a larger-than-life... well, life into a single film. However, Napoleon doesn't tell a complete life story. Director <strong>Abel Gance</strong> had significantly bigger plans.</p><p><strong>Gance wanted this Napoleon to be <a href=#>one of six parts in an ongoing series</a></strong> that would combine to tell the entire life story of its titular character. As such, 1927's Napoleon mostly focuses on the figure's early life and military engagements, with plenty of story effectively left to be told once this mammoth movie is over. Still, for thoroughly unpacking numerous (but far from all) key events in Napoleon Bonaparte's life, and for being a groundbreaking technical masterpiece for its time, this epic remains one well worth devoting the time to.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=39-barry-lyndon-39-1975><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>'Barry Lyndon' (1975)</span></h2><h3 id=directed-by-stanley-kubrick>Directed by Stanley Kubrick</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/barry-lyndon-1975.jpg><p>For as great as Spartacus was, some may come away from it feeling like it wasn't a true Stanley Kubrick film (and the <a href=#>stories of its troubled production might explain why</a>).
