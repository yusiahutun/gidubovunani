I even tried a pretty popular brand of co-wash but was left unimpressed with the way it made my hair feel heavy and greasy. A recent find, <strong><a href=# id=auto-tag_briogeo data-tag=briogeo>Briogeo</a>&nbsp;Be Gentle, Be Kind Avocado + Quinoa Co–Wash</strong> ($20, <a href=# rel=nofollow>sephora.com</a>), may have just made me a believer.</p><p>My hair has a weird in-between <a href=#>wavy texture</a> that makes it hard to find products that work. Products created for curly hair are usually a little too heavy for me, and products made for straight hair don’t do my waves any favors. I also tend to get a really <a href=#>itchy scalp</a> if I use any type of shampoo that strips moisture from my hair and scalp, so I decided to give co-washing another shot when I saw the new Briogeo cleansing conditioner.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static-dailymakeover.stylecaster.com/2014/08/briogeo_co_wash-683x1024.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/briogeonewlaunch.png><p>The no-poo cleanser really moisturizes my hair, which is what all wavy and curly girls truly need (moisturized hair equals less frizz). No co-wash will give hair a squeaky clean feel, but this one doesn’t leave it super greasy, either. Instead, my hair is left with a small amount of gritty texture, which has actually helped in styling it. And if I ever feel like my hair is getting too greasy or there’s too much build-up, I just switch to a clarifying shampoo for a wash.</p><p>To use the product, wet hair and gently massage it into your scalp. Then run it through the ends of your hair. I like to let it sit for a minute before rinsing it out, and then I usually let it air dry. If you’re someone who has always used traditional shampoo, it might take your hair a week or two to adjust to the extra moisture. Try to fight through the greasy stage with some cute <a href=#>updos</a>, and then your scalp will get used to the new co-washing method.</p><p>Read more:&nbsp;<strong><a href=#>Co-Washing 101: Everything You Need to Know about Skipping Shampoo</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLWitdFmpZqhnKh8doKXbG9xZ5KntrCzxKhkm51dnLKvwMueZJudXaC2r7CMnKZmr5GotXA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-masked-singer-double-elimination-recap-comedian-pop-princess.html><span>←</span><span>Iconic Comedian, 'OG Pop Princess' Unmasked</span></a>
