She worked for IMG College at the University of Georgia for three years.&nbsp;Alongside this, she has been on several studio sports-related shows, such as SportsNite, SEC Men’s Basketball Tonight, and Dawg Report.&nbsp;As a commentator, she shared the screen with artists such as Jesse Palmer and Brent Musburger.&nbsp;In 2013, she became ESPN2’s sideline reporter for its weekly college football TV show.&nbsp;The same year, she covered the annual Orange Bowl game for the second time in a row.</span></p><p><span>Being one with total passion for her career, Maria Taylor has extended her tentacles to reporting for other sports.&nbsp;So far, she has analyzed and reported for various other games and shows like the NCAA Women’s Basketball Selection Show and the NCAA Women’s Basketball Tournament.&nbsp;In 2017, Maria joined the ESPN College GameDay broadcast team.&nbsp;For the past two years, she has participated in the network’s coverage of the Women’s National Volleyball Championship and the NCAA Women’s Basketball Tournament.&nbsp;The sportswoman eventually left ESPN in 2018 but signed a collaboration contract with the network for an additional five years.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Salary and net worth</span></strong></h2><p><span>Maria’s net worth as of 2019 is over $2 million, thanks to her renewed contract with US-based pay sports channel ESPN.&nbsp;She would receive an average salary of around $87,885 before her renewed contract with the reputable network in August 2018.</span></p><p><span>Maria earned additional income from appearing on another cable sports channel for college women’s sports coverage.&nbsp;His five-year contract with ESPN is expected to earn him around $100,000 a year.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Boyfriend, Married, Husband</span></strong></h2><p><span>For a socialite like Maria Taylor, one would think she’s very open about her private life, but the reverse seems to be the case since she’s chosen to keep that part of her life out of the media.&nbsp;Because of this, it’s unclear if she has a boyfriend or is in a relationship.&nbsp;What we do know for sure is that the American sports journalist doesn’t have a husband because she’s not married yet.</span></p><p><span>On a few occasions, including her vacation to Palm Springs, Maria has been spotted with a man believed to be her boyfriend.&nbsp;She was even told that she would soon tie the nuptial knot with the mystery man.&nbsp;She even shares a few photos with her unknown boyfriend on her various social media platforms.&nbsp;She is followed by more than 20k fans on Facebook, more than 126k followers on Twitter and more than 134k followers on Instagram.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Height, weight, other measurements</span></strong></h2><p><span>The Georgian-born sports journalist is quite tall with an actual height of 6ft 2in but her other body measurements and weight are still under review but looking at her latest photo posts it is very clear that she has an athletic body.</span></p><p class=postsid
