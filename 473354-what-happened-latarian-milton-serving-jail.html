This happened two weeks after the car rampage incident. Since the car rampage and attacking his grandmother happened close to each other, child protective services demanded a compulsory mental health evaluation.</p><h3>Carjacking</h3><p class=align-left>After seemingly living a good life since the road rampage, he was on the headlines again for the wrong reasons. He was charged with carjacking a vehicle belonging to the Lyft ride-sharing service in suburban West Palm Beach.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5acec1be7094ed97.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Tayler Holder? rise to fame, career, net worth, and family</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The driver picked up four men, including Milton and one woman.

But unfortunately, none of the above dreams saw the light of day as he returned to his bad behaviours. Therefore, it is safe to say that he has not engaged in money-making ventures.</p><h2>Where is Latarian Milton now?</h2><p class=align-left>It is alleged that the delinquent kid is still serving his prison time. Many people believe that he was charged with damaging properties and carjacking. However, the Palm Beach County arrest records show that he is serving his sentence.
