To celebrate the project — their first in 14 years — the trio of Natalie Maines, Martie Maguire and Emily Strayer released a music video for the song on Friday (July 17).</p><p>The "Sleep at Night" video finds the Chicks wandering through a desert town, their dramatic moves subtly telling the story in the song's lyrics. They're often shoulder to shoulder or huddled around each other, symbolically offering support and sisterhood.</p><p>Written by Maguire, Maines and Strayer with Teddy Geiger and Justin Tranter, "Sleep at Night" is a straightforward look at the hurt and anger that accompanies devastating news. The song's protagonist is grappling with the discovery of her husband's infidelity:&nbsp;"My husband's girlfriend's husband just called me up / How messed up is that?" she shares.</p><p>"It’s so insane that I have to laugh," Maines continues. She's clearly reeling, but her concern quickly turns to two other people who will be affected by the news:&nbsp;"But then I think&nbsp;about our two boys trying to become men / There’s nothing funny about that."</p><p>"How do you sleep at night? / How do you tell those lies?" she asks in the chorus. "Lookin’ me in the eye / Livin’ a double life."</p><p>Throughout&nbsp;Gaslighter, there are hints that the affair being described wasn't a particularly well-hidden one — an idea furthered in the second verse of "Sleep at Night." "Remember you brought her to our show at the&nbsp;Hollywood Bowl? / She said, 'I love you I’m such a fan,'" Maines recounts. "I joked that you can love me as long as you don’t love my man&nbsp;..."</p><p>Beyond explaining that her divorce inspired her to write new music, neither Maines nor any of her bandmates have explicitly confirmed that&nbsp;Gaslighter's multiple references to an extramarital tryst are about her ex-husband, actor Adrian Pasdar, whom she recently divorced.&nbsp;All three of the Chicks have been through at least one divorce, and they all co-wrote this particular song.</p><p>However, Maines and Pasdar have two sons together, just as the protagonist of "Sleep at Night" does.&nbsp;Maines' ex-husband is also the one who tried to&nbsp;<a href=#>get a court to hold up the release of the Chicks' new music</a>&nbsp;because it might violate&nbsp;a confidentiality clause in his and Maines' prenuptial agreement.</p><p><strong>Why Were the Chicks Banned, Anyway?</strong></p><p><strong>The Chicks and the Top 100 Albums of All Time</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmraCVYrCptcKkqmarnJqysXnArWSnoZedwW651KygnGWmnrGmu44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./suave-keratin-shampoo-conditioner-review.html><span>←</span><span>Suave Keratin Infusion Shampoo and Conditioner Review</span></a>
