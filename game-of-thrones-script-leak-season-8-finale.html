The Game of Thrones Season 8 finale script was released on the Emmys website. The stage direction reveals that Drogon didn't burn down the Iron Throne on purpose, instead it was a &#34;dumb bystander&#34; to the dragonfire. GoT fans seem even more upset about the revelation. The script for Game of Thrones' finale episode, &#34;The Iron Throne,&#34; was shared on the Emmys website this week after the series earned a whopping 32 nominations for its final season, Huffington Post reported."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Weiss, contains some of Season 8's biggest (and most bewildering) moments, from Daenerys Targaryen's death to Bran the Broken's pseudo-coronation. But the real revelations are found in the stage direction and screenplay notes.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for 7 Game of Thrones deleted scenes that will change the way you watch the show" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/screen-shot-2019-05-21-at-15-51-13-1558450359.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">GoT fans are particularly focused on the scene in which Drogon burns down the Iron Throne with his own dragonfire, seemingly in an emotional rage after finding his mother, Daenerys, stabbed to death on the floor of the throne room. At the time of the finale, viewers <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a27522097/game-of-thrones-drogon-iron-throne-reactions/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="half-joked, half-theorized" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">half-joked, half-theorized</a> about the symbolic significance of Drogon's fiery siege. Did he know that the throne was a symbol for power, and that Dany's irrational craving for power ultimately led to her demise? Or did he associate the dagger in his mother's body with the piles of swords melded into the massive chair?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The answer is neither. According to the script, the throne is "not the target of Drogon's wrath," but "a dumb bystander caught up in the conflagration." The screenplay also emphasizes that the dragon did not want to kill Jon Snow, who was present during the throne-burning and is actually the one who murdered Daenerys.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Read an excerpt of the scene below.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">The dragon rises up on his hind legs, towering over Jon.</h2><h2 data-node-id=17 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">In a beautiful, terrifying tableaux, he roars to the sky, the embodiment of rage.</h2><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">He looks down at Jon.

The smoke clears revealing a puddle of smouldering slag where the throne once stood.</h2><h2 data-node-id=27 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">Who will sit on the Iron Throne?
