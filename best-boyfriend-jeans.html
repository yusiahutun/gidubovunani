Finding the perfect pair means finding just the right blend of fit, texture, and wash, which can sometimes feel impossible. Still, even with all these variables at play, our experts agree that finding the perfect boyfriend jeans is more of an art than a science. But with brands offering more size ranges, fits, and washes than ever before, the task of finding your perfect pair means kissing lots of frogs to find your denim-clad prince.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">That's why, with the help of some fashion experts, InStyle took on the task of finding the best boyfriend jeans for every body, budget, and style, whether you love the Y2K-inspired low-rise fits or the universally flattering high-rise. See below to find your new favorite pair of denim.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-good-american-good-90s-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Good American Good 90's Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Good American Good 90&amp;acirc;s Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/r4AUBdcaOC_3dgxF9WF-cwLL3C8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/good-american-good-90s-jeans-6837aae79b9d4ebca7d4520e0563382b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Good American</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They have that nostalgic 90’s appeal to them.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>With an inseam of 32 inches, it might be too long for petite women.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The perfect boyfriend jeans should look like you stole it directly from a man’s closet, only cinched in at the waist to fit a feminine figure — and these Good American jeans do just that. Baggy from hip to hem, the slouched pants have that classic ‘90’s appeal to them, including a bit of distressing around the waistline, which, by the way, has been fitted for curvy girls to create a gap-free waistline. The pants are described as rigid, but the lyocell included in the fabrication keeps things soft and flexible, giving you more freedom with movements than a typical 100 percent cotton pair. You also won’t notice any stiffness thanks to the nature of the loose-fitted makeup. The longer length (32 inches to be exact) that bunches around the angles makes them more relaxed and ideal for both sneakers and heels (although perhaps slightly too long for petite women).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>00–30 <strong>| Materials: </strong>Cotton, lyocell<strong> | Colors: </strong>1</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-universal-thread-womens-high-rise-boyfriend-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Universal Thread Boyfriend Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Target Universal Thread Boyfriend Jeans " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/VbKi6egAxfwYqsQ2vSwhIJhPUnY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/universal-thread-boyfriend-jeans-5c2ca10c735e4896bfb39dce9492f5cc.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Target</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Despite the affordable price, the denim feels high-quality.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Their striped nature makes them more difficult to style in everyday settings.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">"Target's Universal Thread is basically Rachel Comey without the price tag," says Amy Leverton, trend consultant and author of Denim: Street Style, Vintage, Obsession. The low budget denim features many high-end-looking styles to give your outfit an extra oomph, like patched and topstitched knees but at a fraction of the price.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Unlike other affordable pairs that contain a high percentage of spandex, these only feature a mere two percent; jeans with a lot of spandex can cause a pair to lose their shape over time, but many prefer it to get a better fit, especially over curves. With such a small amount of spandex included, this pair has just enough to ensure a comfortable fit, while maintaining that rigid denim look.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>00–20<strong> | Materials: </strong>Cotton <strong>| Colors:&nbsp;</strong>1</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-redone-high-rise-loose-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>RE/DONE High Rise Loose Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="RE/DONE High Rise Loose Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/i5VBNK5wergeapPqAZwJFU4wQHE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/redone-high-rise-loose-jeans-ded2a825e34e4336872a994faa3b8450.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Re/Done</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The 100 percent cotton jeans will last a very long time.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It comes in a variety of colors, but they’re all light washes.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Re/Done has the magical ability to always fit right, or so senior commerce editor Chloe Anello believes. It’s no wonder then that they’re her favorite place to shop for jeans. It never feels like a gamble here. These ones feature some distressing around the knees and the back of the hem, for a real lived-in feel — though, not all the colorways have distressing, in case you’d rather a rip-free leg. Because the jeans come with a 100 percent cotton composition (so, no elastane included), the rigidness ensures they will mold to your figure, adding to the lived-in look we mentioned, and last a very long time before it’s time to give them up. And while we’re glad it’s offered in five different colors, we wish a few dark washes were available, too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>23–32<strong> | Materials: </strong>Organic cotton <strong>| Colors: </strong>5</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-plus-size-madewell-plus-baggy-straight-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Plus Size</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Madewell Plus Baggy Straight Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Madewell Plus Baggy Straight Jeans " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/bs1oTnjFRsYmzovWuCfNYTz3--M=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/madewell-plus-baggy-straight-jeans-0860c1c268324be1b6af1ecb4496b526.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Madewell</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They’re perfect for both casual and more put together looks.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>They may be a little darker in person than pictured.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Madewell always offers an extensive selection of size-specific clothing, be it <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">maternity</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">petite</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">tall</a>, and even <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">taller</a>. We love these baggy plus size jeans for perfecting the style on our curvier friends as well. They only come in this one vintage wash color, but it’s the perfect look for everyday wear and casual outings. The lack of distressing makes them look more put together as well. Reviewers, however, say that the pants look a little darker in person than the super light wash pictured. Keep that in mind if you’re set on this particular color because it’s possible they’ll vary slightly.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>14–26<strong> | Materials: </strong>Cotton <strong>| Colors: </strong>1</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-distressed-rag--bone-logan-mid-rise-wide-leg></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Distressed</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Rag & Bone Logan Mid Rise Wide Leg</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Rag &amp;amp; Bone Logan Mid Rise Wide Leg " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/SBqM_TNwpJEQz__VQHGgsNf2_Do=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/rag--bone-logan-mid-rise-wide-leg-bf68ef19f8de411ea5e8ad7a904a9345.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Rag & Bone</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s a celeb-loved jean for a perfect model-off-duty look.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The long inseam might cause you to drag the hem on the floor a little.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Loved by <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jennifer Garner</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Jennifer Aniston</a>, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Katie Holmes</a>, Rag & Bone jeans have continuously proved themselves worthy of some closet space. They embody the model-off-duty look, oozing effortlessly chic aesthetics with a wide leg, distressed knees, and an inseam long enough to pair with some heels. This does mean the hem could get dragged on the floor a little, so watch your step as you saunter around. Otherwise, the relaxed look is extremely comfortable, and we guarantee you’ll find yourself reaching for them for every coffee run into town.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>23–32 <strong>| Materials: </strong>Cotton <strong>| Colors: </strong>1</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-petite-asos-bershka-petite-straight-leg-jean></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Petite</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>ASOS Bershka Petite Straight Leg Jean</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="ASOS Bershka Petite Straight Leg Jean " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/D8KJiaB_sF-8O2jatDIvfL6pmCU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/asos-bershka-petite-straight-leg-jean-a29e4ab881c049c2b21741859da424fc.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>ASOS</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They don’t look too oversized on petite women.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The size range could be more inclusive.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We love these pants for having just the right amount of slouch to them. Pants should never look like they’re wearing you, especially for petite women, so we appreciate that this pair hugs the leg a bit more, coming down in a straight (yet slightly baggy) cut down to your ankles. They still have that laid-back, relaxed appeal, but don’t look like they swallow your lower body whole. The model pictured is just over five-foot-two, for reference, and they fit her just right. We only wish it came in a wider size range, so that all may enjoy this cute look.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>0–12<strong> | Materials: </strong>Cotton, viscose <strong>| Colors: </strong>2</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-tall-ksubi-low-rider-legacy-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Tall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Ksubi Low Rider Legacy Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Ksubi Low Rider Legacy" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/7S6k_KbsHzJ1UJdT71PVqy8t4Vs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ksubi-low-rider-legacy-15d5ac17e0e84e0eb43494b7ea79f389.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ksubi</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Even for the five-foot-ten model, the pants reach the floor.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It’s only offered in one color.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Ksubi is known for their quality, rigid denim. For writer Bianca Kratky, who is five foot eight, they always fit phenomenally, from waist to hem. The pants aren’t shy about their height either — they elongate the legs loudly and proudly, pooling at the feet. Even the pictured model, who is five-foot-ten, can wear heels and still have the pants hit the ground. Despite this, the hem doesn’t get destroyed by the ground. It’s likely that the 100 percent cotton is so strong that it’s not easily fazed by little erosions. We love it so much that we only wish it came in more colors. While the very dark wash offers something different to the table — most of the jeans listed here are light or medium wash — it’s not to everyone’s liking.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>23–33<strong> | Materials: </strong>Cotton, recycled cotton <strong>| Colors: </strong>1</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-mid-rise-reformation-val-90s-mid-rise-straight-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Mid Rise</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Reformation Val 90s Mid Rise Straight Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Reformation Val 90s Mid Rise Straight Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/myAIMwesPPcED-QdyW_7HsqAFeE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/reformation-val-90s-mid-rise-straight-jeans-17363904e02242d48e5532a52e199df1.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Reformation</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Just by swapping your shoes from sneakers to heels, you can transform these pants from casual to elegant.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Watch out for the loose strands on the hem.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We all know that low-rise jeans from the Y2K era are back and probably here to stay (whether you like it or not), but for those of you not willing to commit to the bellies-out look, mid-rise is a great alternative. These ones from Reformation will take you from running errands to ladies night out — just swap out your sneakers for heels and voila, the straight pants transform from casual to elegant. You’ll notice a distressed hem as well, so just be careful not to pull any strings there because raw hems like this tend to unravel easily (especially while washing). Otherwise, enjoy the refreshed spin on the classic old-school look.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>23–31<strong>| Materials: </strong>Cotton, tencel lyocell <strong>| Colors: </strong>3</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-low-rise-free-people-we-the-free-shelby-low-rise-boyfriend-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Low Rise</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Free People We the Free Shelby Low-Rise Boyfriend Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Free People Shelby Low Rise Boyfriend Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/i3TX_RE1gfTAttX9BtFk_BREMsQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/free-people-shelby-low-rise-boyfriend-jeans-512e3d57bf1e45998e9d416bd2855fab.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Free People</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>You’ll have these pants for years, thanks to the rigid denim.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>They’re possibly too long for petite women.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For everybody else that’s embracing low-rise pants with enthusiasm, these Free People ones embody the look perfectly. Did you buy them new, or did you pull them out of storage from your middle school days? Maybe you fished them out of a rack at a vintage store? No one would be the wiser. These ones are more slouchy than baggy, which makes them a bit more versatile. The rigid denim also ensures longevity, so you can get as much mileage as possible out of the pair before you switch bag to the timeless high-rise pairs again. Be aware, however, that the inseam is listed as 33 inches, which is quite long.

They’re rigid, thanks to the 100 percent cotton, but the baggy fit keeps them comfortable. The Australian label also always has their focus on sustainability, so you can trust that these were made eco-consciously. While we wish it came in a wider size range, but the loose fit makes it easier for thicker thighs to fill the same size as well.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>2–12<strong> | Materials: </strong>Cotton <strong>| Colors: </strong>3</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Fit</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As with any type of jeans, fit is a personal choice that can't be dictated by trend or style advice. When it comes to boyfriend jeans, some prefer slouchy with a low rise (think <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Free People Shelby Low Rise Boyfriend Jeans </a>), while others only want a slightly-relaxed fit complemented by a high rise (like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Bershka Petite Straight Leg Jean</a>). Of course, there's no right or wrong way to choose which one is right for you, but consider experimenting with different fits to find the one that suits you most. Also, keep in mind that the jeans you leave the store with might not be the jeans you have in a year or two. With patience and a lot of wear, denim conforms to your body, giving you a personalized look that can't be purchased right off the bat.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Sizing</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Unfortunately, the denim industry still has a long way to go when it comes to sizing consistency and availability. Ignore the number on the tag and go with your gut. When trying on boyfriend jeans, grab or order as many sizes in your range as you can, using the mirror as your guide instead of the size. If something looks and feels good, then they're right for you — it's that simple.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Composition and details</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">At the end of the day, a great pair of any kind of jeans, whether they're flares or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>white jeans</a> or anything else, isn't about a brand or style — it's about patience. Boyfriend jeans come in a variety of washes, but the perfect worn color might come through after a few washes and wears. At the same time, if you're picky about a non-manufactured distressed look, you might be better off buying non-distressed jeans and waiting for nature to take its course.

Simple rules can help guide you into making them work for your aesthetic — and truthfully, they look good on everybody and with everything from a basic white T-shirt to a statement jacket. Because they tend to have a boxy fit, Cole prefers to "pair them with something with a feminine touch, like a tight fitted crop."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">But if you're trying to avoid the boxy look altogether try this tip from Leverton: "I like a real tapered silhouette on my boyfriend jeans so if the hem is still a bit wide or if I want to make a straight leg more 'boyfriendy' I fold the inside hem in before rolling it, this creates a really nice tapered look."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As for shoes, boyfriend jeans look phenomenal with both sneakers to heels. The juxtaposition between masculine baggy pants with feminine heels never fails to give you cool-girl-vibes. Throw on a blazer to complete the look.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you distress boyfriend jeans yourself?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When going down the route of distressing boyfriend jeans yourself, choosing the right fabric to start with is key. "Non-stretch (or rigid) denim looks more authentic and wears down more beautifully," says Leverton. Once you have your pair selected, simply grab sandpaper or a razor and rub it back and forth on the place you want to distress. Sandpaper will also soften your jeans which can give your wash a more worn-in look. Remember, patience is key. Try to distress over time, instead of all at once, and after each wash when the fabric is newly broken down.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Bianca Kratky is a commerce writer at InStyle, with over two years of experience covering fashion and beauty products.
