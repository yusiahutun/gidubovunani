Tackling a crazy mane can also be stressful but with one of the best pomades in your styling kit, you can achieve your desired look like a breeze.&nbsp;</p><p>Discussing the benefits of pomades, our contributor Nate Masterson, Hair Expert at Maple Holistics, says, “Pomades help to create slick, smooth finishes and neater hairstyles that have a matte shine on them. Unlike other styling products, they are designed to create a firm hold without weighing the hair down too much. The hold created using a pomade is also longer-lasting compared to other styling products.”</p><p>You must be using shampoos and <a href=#><u>conditioners for thick hair</u></a> to boast overall mane health but a pomade can be of great help when it comes to mastering the styling game. Based on our observation, for years, a pomade has become one of the go-to styling products for its splendid formulation, a hair-nourishing blend of ingredients, smooth texture, and promising hold.&nbsp;</p><p>Pomade is renowned as an excellent alternative to frizz-fighting products like powders, clays, gels, etc, that might leave your hair super crunchy and stiff. So, don’t call your thick hair a curse but a blessing with the right pomade and a <a href=#><u>good-quality hair brush</u></a> in your hands.&nbsp;</p><p>So, come along as we explore, review, and analyze the best of the best pomade for you.

Now, let us run you through a detailed buying guide.</p><p><h2 class=title>How to Choose Pomade for Thick Hair?</h2></p><p>Here are a few aspects that you should consider before splurging on the best pomade for thick hair.</p><p><strong>Hair Type and Length</strong>: Make sure you analyze your hair type before investing in any of the light, medium, or strong hold pomade for thick hair. Some pomades work well on dry, coarse, and short hair whereas a few are crafted specially for medium to long hair. So, consider your hair type and length for creating desirable and long-lasting hairstyles.&nbsp;</p><p>A hair expert, Nate Masterson, says, “It’s important to consider your hair type when purchasing a pomade because the ingredients and formulations will have specific benefits for your unique hair types. For example, pomades for straight hair will be formulated to give you decent hold, while still being lightweight and not weigh your hair down. For curly hair, the pomade will contain hydrating butters and oils to prevent frizz and help fight off dryness.”</p><p><strong>Ingredients</strong>: The next important aspect is the list of ingredients. Ensure that you vouch for the best hair pomade that is enriched with hair-nourishing, hydrating, moisturizing, and natural ingredients like water, glycerin, caster oil, aloe vera, or shea butter. These ingredients do not make your hair stiff or too crunchy. They only lend you desirable hold and shine that lasts all day long.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Texture</strong>: Always consider the texture of the pomade that you are planning to buy. Check whether it needs a hair brush or comb for even application. It is advisable to invest in pomades that feature an easy-to-glide, non-sticky, and non-greasy texture.</p><p><strong>Hold</strong>: For all those who have thick hair require a pomade that promises strong or medium hold. Such types of pomades for thick hair keep your hair in place without succumbing to flyaways and frizz.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Finish</strong>: Last but not least, consider the finish type of the pomade. For a natural and shine-free finish, all you need is a matte pomade. You may also choose a clay pomade for stronger and more mattified results. On the other hand, for shiny and high-gloss results, pick pomades that contain larger amounts of castor oil, glycerin, and water.&nbsp;</p><p>After taking note of the above-mentioned aspects, get to know a few steps of using one correctly.</p><p><h2 class=title>How to Use Pomade for Thick Hair?</h2></p><p>Following are the steps to apply the pomade accurately.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Make sure you wash your hair with a good-quality shampoo followed by a conditioner.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Keep your hair slightly damp and not dripping wet. This will allow the pomade to blend into your hair and look great when it dries. Please note, that if you are using a matte pomade or strong-hold pomade, these won't mix into dry hair.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Start with a small amount of pomade on your fingers and rub your fingers together to get it on all of your fingertips.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: You may use a hair dryer to blow warm air onto the pomade. This will allow the pomade the heat up and get softer.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Begin running your fingers into your hair. Do not apply the pomade to your scalp.</p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: You may use a comb or simply use your fingers and thumb to achieve the desired hairstyle.&nbsp;</p><p>Tada, you are done!</p><p><strong>Contributor:&nbsp;</strong>Nate Masterson, Hair Expert - <a href=#>Maple Holistics</a></p><p>Conclusion</p><p>With the best pomade for thick hair, you can easily create some sleek, suave looks or a messy, textured masterpiece.
