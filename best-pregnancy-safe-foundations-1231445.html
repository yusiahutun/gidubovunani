Our findings show that to keep the baby-mumma duo safe, a vegan, <a href=#>mineral foundation</a> is the answer. To up the ante for your pregnancy glow and a naturally dewy face freshness, here is our curation of the top 12&nbsp;pregnancy-friendly foundations.&nbsp;</p><p>Our top picks</p><p><h2 class=title>12 Best Pregnancy-Safe Foundations</h2></p><p>Add to that pregnancy glow with PÜR's foundation.
