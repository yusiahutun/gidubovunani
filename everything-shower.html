And these days beauty influencers are turning that old stress-relieving practice into a new trend called an “everything shower.” The basic idea behind it is that you set aside some time and create a spa mood with music and nice lighting and then take your time as you go through a complete beauty routine. All it takes is a quick scroll through TikTok and you’ll be inundated with videos from influencers eager to share their detailed showering routines — and I wasn’t the only one curious about this trend as videos on the app tagged with <a href=#>#everythingshower</a> have over 450 million views.</p><p>Judging by the videos I watched, like the one below from TikToker <a href=# rel=noopener>Cheyenne Schug Hertzig</a>, an everything shower is a self-care practice involving doing a number of beauty treatments before, during and after showering.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"><a title=@schugar15 href=#>@schugar15</a><p>My everything shower routine 🧖🏼‍♀️ <a title=everythingshower href=#>#everythingshower</a> <a title=everythingshowerroutine href=#>#everythingshowerroutine</a> <a title=spa href=#>#spa</a> <a title=nancymeyersaesthetic href=#>#nancymeyersaesthetic</a> <a title=nancymeyerschic href=#>#nancymeyerschic</a> <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=fypシ href=#>#fypシ</a> <a title=foryoupage href=#>#foryoupage</a></p><a title="♬ Frenesi - Artie Shaw & His Orchestra & Artie Shaw" href=#>♬ Frenesi – Artie Shaw & His Orchestra & Artie Shaw</a></figure><p>To learn more about this trend and its benefits before testing it out myself, I turned to pros. Read on for all you need to know about an everything shower.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is an everything shower?</h2><p>“An&nbsp;everything shower consists of many different steps to cleansing and nourishing hair, face and body,” says <a href=# rel=noopener>Marisa Garshick, MD</a>, a dermatologist and&nbsp;Assistant Clinical Professor of Dermatology at Cornell, New York Presbyterian Medical Center. “It also involves pre-shower steps as well as post-shower care.” Now,&nbsp;we’re not talking about the usual everyday routine of simply washing your hair and body — an everything shower can include literally everything from a scalp massage to a foot detox, head-to-toe body scrub session and more.&nbsp;“Plus it provides a holistic self-care experience, promoting relaxation and mindfulness while attending to multiple aspects of personal grooming,” adds<a href=# rel=noopener> Justine Kahn,</a> esthetician and founder of <a href=# rel=noopener>Botnia Skincare</a>.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/image-template_4.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The mental-health benefits of an everything shower</h2><p>While it makes sense that an everything shower offers skin and hair benefits, I was intrigued by the mood-boosting perks. Devotees of this trend say it helps relieve stress and lift their spirits. For many fans, like TikToker <a href=# rel=noopener>Kaytlyn Briegge</a> shared in the video below, an everything shower is a weekly or monthly self-care ritual, where they feel free to make themselves a priority.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"><a title=@kaytlynbriegge href=#>@kaytlynbriegge</a><p>Nothing feels better than an everything shower 🫧 <a title=selfcareroutine href=#>#selfcareroutine</a> <a title=selfcare href=#>#selfcare</a> <a title=selflove href=#>#selflove</a> <a title=showerroutine href=#>#showerroutine</a> <a title=showertok href=#>#showertok</a> <a title=skincareroutine href=#>#skincareroutine</a> <a title=nightimeskincare href=#>#nightimeskincare</a></p><a title="♬ Strangers - Kenya Grace" href=#>♬ Strangers – Kenya Grace</a></figure><p>“Self-care rituals, like an everything shower, are activities that are so empowering to women,” says <a href=# rel=noopener>Diana Raab, Ph. D.</a>, self-care expert, blogger at <a href=# rel=noopener>PsychologyToday.com</a> and author of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Writing for Bliss</a>. “Self-care involves taking care of your mind, body and spirit so that you’re more alert and more self-aware, which leads to feeling good about yourself.” This is especially beneficial for those of us with lots of responsibilities, whether they be personal to professional or community-based, as Rabb says engaging in regular self-care rituals helps de-stress, decompress and minimizes the chance of fatigue and burnout.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Why it’s important to practice self-care</h3><p>The beauty of an everything shower is that it allows you to take a break and treat yourself with kindness and self-compassion. And research shows that when we feel cared for, <a href=# rel=noopener>it boosts the production of feel-good hormones like oxytocin and endorphins</a>. In turn, Raab says this can reduce levels of the stress hormone cortisol in the body.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=#>Ways to Lower the Stress Hormone Cortisol in the AM So You Feel Peaceful All Day</a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Ways to up the mood-boosting benefits of an everything shower</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/image-template-1.jpg><p>Additionally, you can further enhance the mental health benefits of an everything shower with a few more touches. “Adding music to your self-care rituals can be very calming and healing,” says Raab. “<a href=# rel=noopener>Certain music can lower the cortisol levels in our body</a> which lowers the stress level, heart rate and blood pressure, and using a scented candle, such as <a href=# rel=noopener>lavender, can also be calming</a>.”&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Avoid taking everything showers too frequently</h3><p>One caveat: If any positive activity becomes more of a habit than a ritual — especially if you feel obligated to do it — these mental health benefits wear off. So there’s no pressure to feel you have to do an everything shower too often. Once every other week or once a month is a good guideline for taking an everything shower.&nbsp;</p><p>And the frequency of an everything shower depends on individual preferences along with skin and hair types. “It’s generally recommended to avoid overly frequent everything showers, as over-exfoliation and overwashing can strip the skin and hair of natural oils,” says Kahn. “For most people, you might just want to do it once a month — and that’s perfectly fine.” She says it’s best to “adjust the frequency based on your skin and hair’s specific needs and any signs of sensitivity or dryness.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How I tested out an everything shower</h2><p>It seemed like an everything shower would be an awesome way to cap off a hectic weekend, and gear up for a busy upcoming week.&nbsp;So I was excited to get started and decided to try it on a Sunday — partially because it meant I could put off starting my most hated chore of the week: dealing with the laundry situation for my family of 5. To begin, I broke it down into different phases, pre-shower, showering and post-shower in order to easily keep track of all I wanted to accomplish and the products I’d need close at hand.</p><p>I also asked Dr. Garshick if there was a particular order it would be best to follow. “In general, it is best to do shampoo and conditioner first, prior to body wash and rinsing your body to ensure any remaining residue is washed off,” she said. “Then, exfoliating is best performed prior to shaving, and it is always important to finish up by moisturizing the skin right after getting out of the shower to keep it supple.” Her advice was similar to the suggestions offered in a viral video (see below) by TikToker and dermatologist<a href=# rel=noopener> Lindsey Zubritsky, MD</a>.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"><a title=@dermguru href=#>@dermguru</a><p>Whats your <a title=everythingshower href=#>#everythingshower</a> routine?

Then, as the water heated up, I dry brushed my body from shoulders to ankles, using circular motions for 2 minutes.</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=#>How To Dry Brush Your Face + the $8 Tool That Will Shed Years From Your Face</a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>During my everything shower routine</h3><p>After getting in the shower, I did my usual <a href=#>reverse hair washing</a> routine, and while I let my conditioner set, I washed my face with an exfoliating cleanser. Once I rinsed out my shampoo, I followed up with a Korean washcloth and an exfoliating body wash. Then, I slathered on shaving cream and shaved my underarms and legs. I also rubbed ¼ tsp. of brown sugar on my lips to exfoliate them as well. And I gave my feet some TLC with a scrub, followed by a final rinse before turning the water off.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Post-everything shower routine</h3><p>As soon as I stepped out of the shower, I lightly dried off with a patting motion using a fluffy towel and quickly applied body lotion. I followed that with eye cream, face lotion and a dab of <a href=#>Aquaphor on my eyelashes,</a> lips and cuticles. Lastly, I massaged foot cream into my tootsies. All in all, I spent just over an hour in the bathroom — and while that seems like a lot of time, it was worth all of the effort.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=#>The Best Body Butters for Soft, Smooth, Glowing Skin: Dermatologists Weigh In</a></p><p>Afterward, I ran my routine by Kahn and asked how I did. “The combination of dry brushing, exfoliation and moisturizing can promote smoother, softer skin and improve circulation,” says Kahn. “All this together can potentially reduce the appearance of cellulite, and promote a healthy head-to-toe glow.” She also said doing a foot scrub toward the end of the shower ensures that thicker skin on heels is softer, and therefore more easily exfoliated.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Tips for customizing an everything shower</h2><p>Kahn also provided some insight for how to personalize an everything shower based on specific skin and hair concerns. Her advice:</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>To repair dry, brittle hair</h3><p>Pre-shower steps like a scalp massage with natural oils such as argan oil, or using a deep-conditioning hair mask can improve hair health, says Kahn.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/image-template_3-1.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading>To nix blemishes and age spots</h3><p>Including facial cleansing, scrubs and masks help clear up and brighten skin. That’s because ingredients in these products help unclog pores and shed dead, discolored skin cells.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>To alleviate dry skin</h3><p>Applying various moisturizers and creams post-shower lock in moisture, preventing dryness and maintaining skin’s elasticity. In fact, <a href=#>studies show that applying moisturizer immediately after showering</a> offers the best hydrating benefits for skin as it increases skin’s moisture levels.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=#>Why Women Over 50 Are Choosing ‘Dry Oils’ to Hydrate and Beautify Their Skin</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/image-template_2-1.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading>To reverse dull skin</h3><p>Kahn advises massaging skin with a sugar scrub for exfoliation, then follow up with body wash and shaving, if necessary.

But most importantly, I felt I could easily tackle my mile-long to-do list for the week. I even found myself humming as I began to sort the dreaded mountain of laundry later that evening.</p><p>So before I went to bed that night, I marked down a date in my calendar to schedule my next everything shower in two weeks time. As I discovered, the power of an everything shower isn’t at all about using the most expensive lotions and products, it’s about enacting a ritual of self-care. The everything shower might be the latest beauty trend, but taking a little time out of our week to treat ourselves should always be in style — after all, we deserve it!&nbsp;</p><p>First For Women aims to feature only the best products and services.
