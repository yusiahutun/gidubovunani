I’ve owned it for just shy of a decade, and even with a stretched-out neckline and some pilling it still holds magic. It’s always felt like the perfect fit, despite its boxy shape and too-long balloon sleeve, and I consider it a grounding garment, something both comfortable and elevated. You can see and feel the work that went into making the piece, but it manages to look effortless.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I keep coming back to the sweater because of this specific kind of sartorial sensory connection Van Noten’s handiwork evokes. And watching his Spring 2024 collection at Paris Fashion Week, I had all those same feels—even through a screen. These are clothes that beg you to hit the zoom button, to focus on the twisty, tactile nature of the fabric and the proportions. The opening looks bordered on prep, in a palette of khaki and navy and brown with touches of light-wash denim. At first glance, they appeared to be pieces we’ve all seen before, but as Van Noten is known to do, he tricked us in the best way possible. To wit: A rather basic rowing jacket was actually shrunken down in size, paired with an equally shrunken open oxford shirt, a matching bra, and a maxi cargo wrap skirt. Van Noten also took what could have been a “mid” tan dress and messed it up in just the right way, by gathering the fabric with a zigzagging grosgrain ribbon down the front. In other words, the classics were reimagined into something unrecognizable.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As the collection progressed, these subtly anti-prototypal pieces gave way to even more expressions of crafty dress, namely with his signature prints and layering. Especially inspiring was the combination of rugby shirts with paillette-sequin-decorated skirts, and a somewhat monastic cocoon coat with a straight line of mixed-material beading. And in a season where there have been too many shorts to stomach, Van Noten has even managed to make jorts suits wildly crave-able.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 e1jtuqk11"></span><h5 class="css-13733z5 e1jtuqk13">Dries Van Noten RTW Spring/Summer 2024</h5><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 e1jtuqk10"></span><img alt="dries van noten ready to wear spring summer 2024" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/van-noten-s24-001-65158e77596b4.jpg title="dries van noten ready to wear spring summer 2024" width=2574 height=3861 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Gallery<span class="css-1w4f7je es31yw60"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt title="Black right arrow" width=100% height=auto decoding=async role=img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When a designer can pinpoint the needs of a potential wearer while also encouraging them to think beyond the wardrobe they already have, that’s real fashion. Marni’s Francesco Risso accomplished this, as well. Like Dries Van Noten’s, Marni’s collection was also delightfully tactile—especially the spectacular sculpture dresses decorated with flowers made from recycled plastic—but also included a sense of romance. For Risso, this collection was deeply personal; on the show invitation, he wrote about his first visit to Paris as a teenager and a chance encounter with a boy whose scent he still remembers. He alluded to his long, deep love affair with Paris, with all of its sounds and sights and smells.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After staging his last two shows in New York and Tokyo, Risso felt the need to come back to a place he considers home, a place that provided him with a pathway to love and creativity. He showed the Spring 2024 collection for Marni at Karl Lagerfeld’s old apartment at 51 Rue de l’Université, adjacent to a place Risso lived when he was younger. In interviews and show notes, Risso has used the word flâneur quite liberally to describe the vibe of his clothes, and it was visibly accurate: Every piece came stitched with curiosity, the kind plucked from the nothings we stroll by when we’re wandering through a place.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">You could feel it in the stripes on stripes on stripes and in the crinoline skirt that looked like it was swept upward by a breeze and stuck in place. You could feel it in the exaggerated tent dresses that took up space in such a way that they could—and probably did—graze everything in their path. You even felt it in the opening look: a floor-sweeping skirt slung low at the hips with a bodycon ribbed top that was made for flitting about. There were both depth and lightness in that little sleeveless sweater, a piece of clothing that, like my own favorite well-worn knit, goes further than most.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 e1jtuqk11"></span><h5 class="css-13733z5 e1jtuqk13">Marni RTW Spring/Summer 2024</h5><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 e1jtuqk10"></span><img alt="marni ready to wear spring summer 2024" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/marni-po-s24-001-65158f31f3f84.jpg title="marni ready to wear spring summer 2024" width=2574 height=3861 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Gallery<span class="css-1w4f7je es31yw60"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt title="Black right arrow" width=100% height=auto decoding=async role=img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfm660tMiopWiZZGqAdoOXbG5opZGnu6p5w6ugnqtdq66vec2oq56mXai9s7XNoGRraGJpfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./64492e68ca47419a208b45e4-html.html><span>←</span><span>Ligue 1: Messi, Neymar y Mbapp: un tridente en serio peligro</span></a>
