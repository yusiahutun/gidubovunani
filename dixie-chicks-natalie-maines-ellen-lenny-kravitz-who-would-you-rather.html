It's a PG show, so we'll assume Ellen meant which Hollywood star or musician would you rather date. It starts with&nbsp;Jake Gyllenhaal and Harry Styles — Maines picks the older Gyllenhaal. In fact ,the actor does quite well, steamrolling the competition until&nbsp;he comes up alongside Brad Pitt.</p><p>Drake, John Mayer and&nbsp;Leonardo DiCaprio are a few more of the 45-year-old's choices. Bradley Cooper gives her pause, and Lenny Kravitz elicits quite a memory between the two, although Kravitz wasn't an active participant. Watch the whole segment below.</p><p>"All through high school and college, I absolutely, 100 percent believed I was going to marry Lenny Kravitz,"&nbsp;Maines shares. "Not even a joke. People are like 'Haha, that's funny' and I was like, 'No, it's happening.'"</p><p>At the end of their appearance, Ellen and the women talk a little about the 2003 controversy, with Maines saying the group definitely felt like the first one to be canceled in a cancel culture on social media.</p><p class=p1>“I think what I said back then would not even be a thing today, because it was really mild compared to what people say today," she shared, with McGuire and Strayer nodding in agreement.</p><p class=p1>In 2006 they released Taking the Long Way, an album that touches on the heated debate and black-listing. <a href=#>Gaslighter</a>, available on May 1, is their first album since then.</p><p><strong>What Did the Dixie Chicks Say to Get Banned?</strong></p><p><strong>See the Best Country Albums of the 2000s, Including the Dixie Chicks:&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmnaGonrJur8eimqSrXaOuta3LopxmpZGeu6a%2FjJ6jpZ2eYrmmus2yZKSqkau2tcaMsJ%2BoZaekwq2wjLKmrmWilsGpsdFo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lucy-pinder-page-3-boobs-17040981.html><span>←</span><span>Lucy Pinder lays Page 3 credentials bare in see-through lingerie for 2018 calendar</span></a>
