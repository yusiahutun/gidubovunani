"We turned it into an all positive love song because it would appeal to a broader audience than a personal message would."</p><p>"I get carried away by the look by the light in your eyes / Before I even realize the ride I'm on / Baby, I'm long gone / I get carried away nothin' matters but bein' with you / Like a feather flyin' high up in the sky on a windy day / I get carried away," Strait sings in the chorus.</p><p>"The chorus just sort of arrived," continues Bogard. "The words and music stayed pretty much as they were recorded. Jeff and I actually completely re-wrote the second verse as he stood at the microphone in the studio to sing the demo."</p><p>"It might seem like an ordinary night / Same ol' stars, the same ol' moon up high / But when I see you standin' at your door / Nothin's ordinary anymore," he sings tenderly in the lyrics of the song's verse.</p><p>"George and [his producer] Tony Brown made a great record and pretty much stuck to the road map we gave them," Bogard says proudly. "<a href=#>Ronnie Dunn</a> wanted to hold the song as well, but was about an hour behind the folks at [George's label]."</p><p>'Carried Away' was released as the second single from Strait's 'Blue Clear Sky' and was nominated for Single of the Year at the 1997 CMA Awards, along with 'One Night at a Time,' off of the 1997 album 'Carrying Your Love With Me.'</p><p><strong>Watch George Strait Perform 'Carried Away' in the '90s<br></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmoJ2fp7SmedKtqZqhpGKwor7RopydZZGsrrp5y7KpopujZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./moniece-slaughter-glorilla-beef-instagram-deleted-beef.html><span>←</span><span> GloRilla Accused of Getting Moniece Slaughter's IG Account Deleted</span></a>
