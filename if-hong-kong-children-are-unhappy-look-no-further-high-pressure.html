The <span class="c1 css-1mniedq eq9i9439" data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-1>result-oriented education system must share some of the responsibility. Most parents want their children to go to university, but university places in Hong Kong are limited. Attending university is a step towards joining the ranks of the elite, but this often comes at the cost of children losing their innocence. The result is a cohort of anxious nine-year-olds.</span></p><h4 type=h5 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0"><span data-eom-type=bookmark id=em_10_start class="c2 css-1mniedq eq9i9439" data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0></span>Watch: How stressed are Hong Kong’s students?</h4><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Other countries have a more relaxed approach to primary schooling. Many early primary schools in Iceland have lessons for only six hours a day and the subjects tends to be very practical. These countries focus not so much on academic achievement, especially in the early years, but on all-round development. They do not put pressure on young children by forcing them to do lots of homework, unlike in Hong Kong.</p>A survey by the Hong Kong Parents League for Education Renovation found that <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">60 per cent of children</span></a> spent more than 1½ hours on assignments after class and some 23 per cent said their children spent more than 2½ hours on homework.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">No wonder children in Iceland seem to love going to school. Could we say the same of Hong Kong?</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I believe the main reason children in Hong Kong are less joyful is their school life. I hope the government will use the education system in foreign countries as a reference to create a happy and relaxed environment for kids in Hong Kong.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Eunis Au, Tseung Kwan O</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ksLC5zJ6lrWecmsG1sdGsZpqqpJ6wrbGOa2hvaGJofXC1xWafqKaXYriwusZmmqGhnJm%2FprqMmqmeZaWjtaK8z7JkpaefoHqvu4yfrKusmJq%2FbrTIoJ9mqKKawLTB0Z4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-to-get-invited-met-gala.html><span>←</span><span>How To Get Invited to the Met Gala</span></a>
