You’ll never run out of videos to watch, let alone try-ons that actually show you how it looks on and whether it stays put throughout the day. Lately, my eyes have been glued on one TikToker, in particular: @katiehub.org. She’s known for her extensive <a href=# id=auto-tag_mascara data-tag=mascara>mascara</a> collection and recommendations (or warnings), and her lashes are truly to die for.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p><span>One of her TikToks I stumbled upon recently had me Googling the mascara as soon as I was done watching the video. @katiehub.org shared with viewers that <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Maybelline made a mascara that’s like “instant lash extensions,”</a> per the brand. It’s called the Illegal Length Mascara</span>, which is finally back in stock on <a href=# id=auto-tag_amazon data-tag=amazon>Amazon</a> and also 18 percent off. The mascara typically costs $12 but is down to under $10 right now. There’s no better time than the present to stock up and save!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"></figure><p><span>After one coat of mascara, @katiehub.org’s eyelashes are everything you want them to be: long, curled, lifted, and defined. And it’s not just because she already has stunning natural lashes. The product has earned a 4.2-star overall rating on Amazon, with numerous reviewers saying the exact same thing as the content creator.</span></p><p><span>“After [having] lash extensions in for months, I decided my lashes needed [a] break. Then I was on the quest for a comparable mascara to what looked like extensions. After trying a dozen high-rated ones, this is the holy grail,” explained one shopper. “It does not clump; <a data-pmc-sp-product=d4d61c95f0e9d9291a540cdcc8392bf7 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"my lashes are so long","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Maybelline Illegal Length Fiber Extensions Washable Mascara, Instant Lashes, No Flaking, Blackest Black, 1 Count","price":"9.82","id":"B006UETA1U","category":"Mascara"},"id":1332449,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>my lashes are so long</a> with this!”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Keep reading for what makes this affordable mascara so coveted by TikTokers and shoppers alike.</span></p><p><b><strong>RELATED: </strong></b><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>This $8 Mascara Is So Volumizing, Reviewers Warn: ‘Don’t Get Lash Extensions Before You Try This’</strong></a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/maybelline-illegal-length-mascara-amazon.jpeg><p>TikTok-Viral</p><p>Maybelline Illegal Length Mascara</p><p>On Sale 18% off</p><p><span>You probably don’t already have a mascara like the Illegal Length one, and that’s because it has 4 millimeters of lash extension fibers and a Fiber-Fix brush that seamlessly coats each lash with the fibers.
