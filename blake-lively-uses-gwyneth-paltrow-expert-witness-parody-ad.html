To find out, we asked an expert witness."</p><p>The clip then cut to Scher -- who was labeled as a "Fizzicist" -- referencing stick figures on a whiteboard. Each figure featured a smiley face and a picture of a Betty Buzz bottle in their hands.</p><p>"See, when you look at a person drinking Betty Buzz Meyer Lemon soda, they have a smile on their face," Scher said, drawing an arrow with a dry-erase marker to point to the first smiley-faced stick figure. "And they think, 'Wow, so bubby.'</p><p>Moving on to the second figure, Scher continued, "Another person drinks sparkling grapefruit and says out loud, 'Mmm! Betty Buzz tastes great.'"</p><p>"And of course, in both cases, the Betty Buzz goes down into their stomachs here, which is consistent with the laws of physics and Newton's laws," he added, with the ad clearly poking fun at Scher's line from the trial in which he said, "Paltrow's version is consistent with the laws of physics."</p><p>The ad concluded with the narrator saying, "Case closed! Betty Buzz is probably scientifically the best sparkling beverage in the world."</p><p>Following the sound of a gavel, Scher can be heard replying, "I didn't necessarily say that."</p><p>"You did, and you also said, 'Case closed.' Thank you, Dr. Scher," the narrator hilariously said in response to Scher, who replied, "No, you said that. What's happening right now?"</p><p>Watch the funny ad in the clip, above!</p><p>The ski crash trial -- which concluded last month -- was between Paltrow and retired optometrist Dr. Terry Sanderson over a 2016 ski slope collision. Sanderson sued Paltrow for more than $300,000, saying her reckless skiing led to broken ribs and permanent brain damage. She countersued for $1 and attorney fees, claiming he was responsible for the crash.</p><p>The jury ultimately <a href=#>ruled in Paltrow's favor</a>, voting that Sanderson caused their 2016 ski accident in Utah and was "100% at fault." The jury awarded the actress the $1 she had filed in her countersuit.</p><p>One of the jurors who sided with Paltrow -- Samantha Imrie -- <a href=#>spoke about</a> the trial in an interview with ABC News, crediting Scher for solidifying her decision and helping Paltrow win her case.</p><p>"He's a snow sports expert in many different ways," she said. "I think the fact that Dr. Scher could speak to the din settings and he specifically studied snow science, that he had a stronger opinion."</p><a id=gallery-link-43830259-3ba9-47d3-a14d-0a8fe6f09cee class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:43830259-3ba9-47d3-a14d-0a8fe6f09cee data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:65ba17ee-13a8-4366-948f-e4e2105fa0e4 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/0d/4by3/2023/04/10/0dcf99b9ae814a43b4cba0d7911ce2ec_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j21mampfl7mit8Rmo6KulaHGbsHSnqpmn6euu6bAx2anmqSkp7y4ecSxp56qpGLEqsDNnqqsZaCWv7Cw2GaYnWc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./amber-fields-instagram-star-age24-bf-biography-wiki-net-worth-boyfriend-height-more.html><span>←</span><span>AMBER FIELDS -[Instagram Star]Age(24)bf,Biography, Wiki, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
