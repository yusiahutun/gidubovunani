Is listening to music... fun? And more to the point, what is fun? Let's find out in our hands-on EarFun Free 2 review.</p><h2 id=earfun-free-2-sound-quality>EarFun Free 2 Sound Quality</h2><p>True wireless earbuds for $60? They must have a flaw, right?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/earfun-free-2-earbuds-in-ear.jpg><p>The EarFun Free 2 aren't perfect, but you'll definitely be surprised with the sound quality. Not to say that the EarFun Free 2 are amazing, because they're not. You're not spending top dollar on a premium wireless earbud, and the sound quality of these earbuds reflects this.</p><p>So, how do a 60 buck pair of earbuds sound?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Focusing on the good and fun side of things, the EarFun Free 2 are perfectly competent and handle any music well enough. The overall quality is surprisingly good, and you can listen to music with the EarFun Free 2 buds for hours at a time. The audio has a significant bass boost, and although the treble is similarly boosted, the combination doesn't always work well. Still, with the mids and highs well represented and bass to spare, music is fun.</p><p>How that translates to individual tracks and styles also throws up some interesting results.</p><p>One of the best albums of 2021 so far, Nas' King's Disease II, sounds excellent. The turned-up bass and tuned mids deliver each track with punchy precision, allowing the sublime wordsmith to shine.</p><p>The EarFun Free 2 brings the fun to another excellent release from this year, Sons of Kemet's Black to the Future. The wild jazz rhythms fizz and pop over the earbuds, and each of the guest features comes through loud and clear.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>However, with other tracks, the EarFun Free 2 earbuds can struggle. Pop on something with explosive vocals like London Grammar, and vocalist Hannah Reid's voice isn't as crisp and emotive as it can be with other headsets or earbuds.</p><p>Overall, it's a decent audio experience that doesn't disappoint, but also one that doesn't blow you away with audiophile quality. But that's also where the EarFun Free 2's mish-mash of features reveals itself.</p><p>Yes, the Free 2 earbuds support Qualcomm's aptX codec and are capable of high-res audio streaming, and Bluetooth 5.2 makes audio streaming simple, fast, and precise, but the EarFun Free 2's issues with bass and the top-end mean that you don't always recognize or realize the full range of the high-res audio output.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Other people might take issue with the lack of premium features like ANC, but at this price, it's more than you can expect. Competitors that attempt to include active noise cancellation at this price range often have to cut corners elsewhere, sacrificing build quality or battery life. These are a budget set of earbuds. If you're looking for fully-fledged ANC, you'll have to reach deeper into your pocket. Adding to this, the lack of ANC doesn't affect the performance of the Free 2 buds in any way.</p><p>In terms of microphone quality, you won't struggle to make a call or be heard while using the EarFun Free 2. The microphones pick up a good volume in various situations, with most people reporting that my voice was clear and easy to hear while at home, when out walking, and even in windy situations. Microphone call quality comes with support from Qualcomm's cVc 8.0, which uses advanced noise suppression and echo canceling to make sure every word you speak is received with clarity.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=earfun-free-2-earbuds-have-excellent-battery>EarFun Free 2 Earbuds Have Excellent Battery</h2><p>Audio quality discrepancies aside, the EarFun Free 2 earbuds deliver a lot of quality in other areas. Battery life is definitely one of them, with the earbuds holding up to seven hours of charge along with another 23 hours of playback in the charging case.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Through multiple days of testing the earbuds, I rarely ran out of battery. However, when you do run low, the EarFun Free 2 can pick up two hours of playback on a quick 10-minute charge, giving you enough for your commute or gym session. The Free 2 earbuds also support wireless Qi charging.</p><p>Another plus point for the EarFun Free 2 earbuds is the IPX7 dust and waterproof rating, with additional SweatShield technology.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Connectivity comes from Bluetooth 5.2, and the earbuds connect almost instantaneously to any device. The speed of reconnection between different devices is also impressive: moving from a smartphone to a laptop comes with almost zero down downtime.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Interestingly, you can also switch into low-latency mode, which drops the latency between the Free 2 and your device to "as low as 60ms" but does reduce the broadcast range significantly. For music, this low-latency mode isn't really necessary, but if you're sitting and watching a film or otherwise, low-latency is worth using. The switch to low-latency mode didn't have any particularly discernable effect on battery life either, with the earbuds still returning between six and seven hours playback with the mode switched on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-earfun-free-2-earbuds-look-good-and-are-comfy>The EarFun Free 2 Earbuds Look Good and Are Comfy</h2><p>Comfort is everything when you're wearing earbuds, and the EarFun Free 2 is definitely one of the comfiest pairs of earbuds I've worn in a while.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The shape of the Free 2 buds is similar to the Jabra Elite 85T, which is no bad thing. Although predominantly built with plastic, they're nicely rounded and have a good build quality with an all-black finish.</p><p>The three different silicone ear tips mean you can find at least one option to suit your ears, choosing between small, medium, and large. As we've said countless times, earbud comfort is subjective, but you can get a good sense of comfort during prolonged usage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once the EarFun Free 2 earbuds are positioned snuggly in your ear, they're unlikely to move again. I tried them in a variety of situations, including running and cycling, and the earbuds didn't budge an inch. Well, maybe a little movement, but never enough to feel like the Free 2 buds were about to leap from my ears into the abyss.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>As far as earbud cases go, the EarFun Free 2 is standard. The lid is fairly resolute in remaining shut while being transported around or thrown into a bag and the latch and magnets seem strong enough to withstand most challenges. And the hold-upside-down-and-shake-vigorously test was passed with flying colors.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=touch-controls-are-easy-to-use>Touch Controls Are Easy to Use</h2><p>Touch controls are integral for any set of true wireless earbuds. The EarFun Free 2 has several built-in tap options available for each earbud, and while these are not customizable, you should get along with the default options just fine.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Single tapping adjusts the volume, double-tapping answers or ends a phone call, and triple tapping will skip or replay the currently playing track. Now, the EarFun Free 2 works with personal assistants, and you can access them by tapping the right bud and then holding them for two seconds. Similarly, you can switch the aforementioned low-latency mode on by tapping the left bud and the holding for two seconds (do the same to switch it off again).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The large rounded face makes using touch controls on the EarFun Free 2 simple, and the receiver is large enough that most attempts to change a track or raise the volume register perfectly each time. Given how many options are integrated into the buds to begin with, you don't miss the customization options that might come with a companion app, but rest assured that the earbuds cost a lot less than other earbuds that come with such features.</p><h2 id=are-the-earfun-free-2-earbuds-any-good>Are the EarFun Free 2 Earbuds Any Good?</h2><p>Reviewing the EarFun Free 2 true wireless earbuds has, accordingly with the name, been fun. You're not buying a set of monitor earbuds, you're buying a pair of budget earbuds that are designed for audio on the go.</p><p>So, should you buy the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">EarFun Free 2</a> earbuds? At $60, these exemplify the term "budget true wireless earbuds." The solid battery life of up to 30 hours playback beats out some more expensive alternatives, and the Bluetooth 5.2 connectivity is excellent.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While the Free 2 audio quality can be troublesome from time to time, depending on the genre, the soundstage on offer is more than decent even during long listening sessions. If you're not too fussy about your music sound slightly different and don't demand a completely flat EQ, you'll get along with the EarFun Free 2 just fine.</p><p>You cannot criticize EarFun for any design decisions made with these earbuds. They set out to compete in the budget wireless earbud market, and compete, they certainly do. So if you're in the market for earbuds that won't break the bank but deliver a fun listening experience, look no further than the EarFun Free 2 earbuds.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGicmqqWqrtustGenGZqXaeyt7XEsGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./killer-couples-family-home-death-house-little-boys-girls-html.html><span>←</span><span>Killer couples: How the family home became a death house for little boys and girls</span></a>
