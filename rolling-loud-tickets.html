Since its inception in 2015, the festival has hosted its 3-day stint of performances for rap fans in Los Angeles, New York and Sydney, with its first touchdown in Europe officially taking place in 2022. The festival was temporarily stalled in 2020 due to our global health crisis, but picked back up again in 2021 with over 140 of hip-hop’s biggest names on the bill. According to Rolling Loud co-founder Tariq Cherif, the demand for tickets was so high that dates in Miami sold out in under two hours. “We’ve never sold out that fast,” he told Complex in 2021. “They would’ve sold out even faster if we could have more people buy them at once. We can only have 17,000 people at a time putting tickets in the cart. The waiting page, at any given moment, had 150,000 people in it.”</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>Throughout the years, Rolling Loud has seen acts like Schoolboy Q, Action Bronson, A$AP Rocky, Kanye West and many more perform at its venues across North America and beyond.
