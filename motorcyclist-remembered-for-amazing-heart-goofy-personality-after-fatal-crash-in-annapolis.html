Some would say he burned both ends of his wick, others would say he truly lived, experiencing love and life to its fullest," Corynne Romo, the best friend of Nutter's longtime partner <strong><a href=#>said</a></strong>.</p><p>During his brief life, Nutter proved to be a curious man straight from the beginning, and was a lifelong learner who knew no limits.</p><p>"As a toddler David was found catching peacock bass the size of himself, as a teenager you might find him sketching cartoon characters, and as an adult he would apply his (MacGyver) like talents to fix anything. He also applied his ADHD to organizing things (or re-organizing others’ things…)," organizers of a <strong><a href=#>GoFundMe</a>&nbsp;<a href=#>campaign</a></strong> mused.</p><p>Nutter was <strong><a href=#>remembered</a></strong> as an active man who had a passion - and talent - on the ice playing hockey, as well as a skilled skateboarder who performed tricks with no abandon.</p><p>"David always exhibited passion and put a part of himself into whatever he was doing. That curiosity and care wasn't limited to his hobbies, his aura extended to the people he loved as well," Romo <strong><a href=#>added</a></strong>. "David had a curious and fearless spirit, always seeking new adventures and knowledge."&nbsp;</p><p>In the days since his death, more than <strong><a href=#>$3,000</a></strong> has been raised in support of their family as they begin to prepare for Nutter's celebration of life this weekend.</p><p>"You were my bright light of happiness for the past 9yrs. We were babies when we met. I was only 21 and you were 23 but you helped form me into the person i am today," partner Natalie Dennin posted on Facebook in a <strong><a href=#>touching tribute</a></strong>. "Your kindness and generosity is something unmatched by anyone else. I am truly so in love and amazed by you.</p><p>"Your ability to teach yourself new skills / hobbies and accomplish anything you put your mind to was astonishing to witness. You were so unapologetically you and never cared what anyone else thought.'&nbsp;</p><p>There will be no funeral, but instead, a massive party and celebration of Nutter's life is scheduled to begin at 3 p.m. on Saturday, Nov. 11 at 223 Scott Drive in Annapolis - and you should bring a hockey jersey (or something orange).</p><p>Tributes have poured in since Nutter's death.</p><p>"David was like a brother to me and my family was lucky enough to keep a relationship with David from childhood into adulthood, which as an adult I now know is so rare," Taylor Wilhelm-Kork <strong><a href=#>wrote</a></strong>.&nbsp;"I will miss his smile, his warm, familiar way, his honesty, his goofiness."&nbsp;</p><p>"Anyone that knew him, whether it was his whole life or only met one time, can honestly say what an amazing heart David had," Romo <strong><a href=#>said</a></strong>. "He welcomed everyone in to his life with the biggest smile and so much joy.&nbsp;</p><p>"He was such a kind and fun soul with so much love and positivity radiating from him at all times," <strong><a href=#>she continued</a></strong>. "David my heart breaks every single day since I heard the news and I still don't believe that it is real."</p><p>Those interested in donating to Nutter's family can do so <strong><a href=#>here</a></strong>.</p><p><strong>Want breaking news in the DMV as it happens, or want to contribute? <a href=#>Join the DMV All Incidents Facebook group.</a></strong></p><p class=e-click-here-follow-btn><a class=e-email-signup js-follow-button href=#>Click here</a> to follow Daily Voice Anne Arundel and receive free news updates.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmickZ65usLOopqeZpOkunC5wKuwpZmemXyius2eZJqqpaOxpriOpqatp6KYxqS4yKyrZqqVorKursSrnJ1llqS%2Fbq3MmrGippditaat0a1koKefm8ZuvMSrqqimkaG2tcWMmp2tnaJis6LAwKVknKqRqLVutc1mmKemkaW8rbXSaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmotorcyclist-remembered-for-amazing-heart-goofy-personality-after-fatal-crash-in-annapolis.html&text=Motorcyclist%20Remembered%20For%20%27Amazing%20Heart%2c%27%20%27Goofy%20Personality%27%20After%20Fatal%20Crash%20In%20Annapolis&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmotorcyclist-remembered-for-amazing-heart-goofy-personality-after-fatal-crash-in-annapolis.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmotorcyclist-remembered-for-amazing-heart-goofy-personality-after-fatal-crash-in-annapolis.html&title=Motorcyclist%20Remembered%20For%20%27Amazing%20Heart%2c%27%20%27Goofy%20Personality%27%20After%20Fatal%20Crash%20In%20Annapolis" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmotorcyclist-remembered-for-amazing-heart-goofy-personality-after-fatal-crash-in-annapolis.html&title=Motorcyclist%20Remembered%20For%20%27Amazing%20Heart%2c%27%20%27Goofy%20Personality%27%20After%20Fatal%20Crash%20In%20Annapolis" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmotorcyclist-remembered-for-amazing-heart-goofy-personality-after-fatal-crash-in-annapolis.html&title=Motorcyclist%20Remembered%20For%20%27Amazing%20Heart%2c%27%20%27Goofy%20Personality%27%20After%20Fatal%20Crash%20In%20Annapolis" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmotorcyclist-remembered-for-amazing-heart-goofy-personality-after-fatal-crash-in-annapolis.html&description=Motorcyclist%20Remembered%20For%20%27Amazing%20Heart%2c%27%20%27Goofy%20Personality%27%20After%20Fatal%20Crash%20In%20Annapolis" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./pennridge-high-school-principal-charged-with-dui-police.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Pennridge High School Principal Charged With DUI: Police">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./man-killed-in-crash-that-shut-down-route-322-in-state-college.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Man killed in crash that shut down Route 322 in State College">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
