It’s unclear whether Meghan Markle will be by her husband’s side yet, but one expert claims Harry ‘won’t bring his children’ without his wife by his side.</strong></p><p><a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> and <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> left the <a href=#>royal</a> family in 2020, and never looked back, currently residing in the States. When they left, their eldest, Prince Archie was just nine months old, and they hadn’t yet had their youngest, Princess Lilibet. That means Harry’s father, <a href=#>King Charles</a> is believed to have only met his granddaughter once, during <a href=#>Queen Elizabeth</a>‘s Platinum Jubilee in 2022.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/04/GettyImages-1422753964-780x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-prince-harry-is-extremely-unlikely-to-bring-his-children-to-the-uk-without-meghan-suggests-royal-expert>Prince Harry ‘is extremely unlikely’ to bring his children to the UK without Meghan,’ suggests royal expert</h2><p>The Duke will definitely be making his way over to the UK next month, but ultimately, it’s claimed his wife ‘will be the ultimate decider’ of whether the four of them will visit together, according to royal expert Richard Fitzwilliams.</p><p>“Meghan has the say,” he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told</a> Bella Magazine. “There’s no doubt Harry wishes to convey he is a very devoted family man and will put them above everything else. Just like <a href=#>Prince William</a>.”</p><p>Richard then added that the Duke is “extremely unlikely” to come over to the UK with the children without the Duchess of Sussex, and that she “could never be forced to.”</p><p>It was recently reported that Meghan ‘didn’t feel safe’ traveling to Britain, as Harry is said to have ‘begged’ his wife to join him&nbsp;next month.</p><p>Harry’s last visit to his home country was a flying visit in Feburary, after his father, King Charles, revealed he had <a href=#>been diagnosed with cancer</a>.</p><p>Meghan has not visited since September 2022. The <a href=#>couple</a> touched down on UK soil on September 4, for an appearance at the One Young World Summit&nbsp;in Manchester the next day. They were then set to attend the WellChild Awards on September 8, however Queen Elizabeth sadly passed away that afternoon.</p><p>Harry and Meghan then remained in the UK longer than anticapted, throughout the mourning period and the funeral of the monarch.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-harry-lists-us-as-official-residency-four-years-later>Harry lists US as official residency – four years later</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/04/GettyImages-529651666-1024x738.jpg><p>It’s official, Prince Harry <a href=#>is now a US resident</a>, according to paperwork. On Monday April 15, the Duke&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>listed</a>&nbsp;his new country of residence as the United States. It comes four years after the couple moved into their <a href=#>Montecito mansion</a>&nbsp;in California.</p><p>The couple didn’t settle in the States as soon as they left England. Canada was the first place they stayed, a country close to Meghan’s heart, where she filmed <a href=#>TV</a> drama Suits.</p><p>They then spent three months <a href=#>at Tyler Perry’s house</a> when first moving to LA, before buying their own pad.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlsX2d9cLzRoqWcnV2drrO%2B2GauqKakYq%2Bztc2gZKGho2KwqbXLnamepl2pvG6%2FxJ5knKCRp7mmv4yinWallZy1orqMoqqnrF2ptaa%2BxGaqmrGjYrK5vMSrq2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mercedes-colwin-wiki-age-husband-net-worth-html.html><span>←</span><span>Mercedes Colwin Wiki, Age, Husband, Net Worth</span></a>
