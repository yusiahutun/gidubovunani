Here's how to recreate the look for yourself.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-coquette-makeup></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Is Coquette Makeup?&nbsp;</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For those who have yet to encounter coquette makeup on their FYP (since it is, no surprise, yet another TikTok trend), it's "über-feminine, a touch romantic, flirtatiously playful, and nostalgic," says makeup artist Michelle Clark, senior national artist at MAC Cosmetics.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In practice, that means it emphasizes colors like soft-focus pinks, a shimmer finish, and, importantly, flushed cheeks — which adds to its hyper-feminine feel.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-create-coquette-makeup></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Create Coquette Makeup</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">First, know that the key product to getting coquette makeup right is your blush. ""It is absolutely non-negotiable," says Clark. "It centers the makeup, as it wraps the upper cheekbone and goes onto the lid and through the crease." Once you have your blush of choice in hand, you're ready to go.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Start with a dewy foundation for that radiant glow. Once you set your base, you're ready for your blush. "Sweep a radiant pink blush on the apples of the cheek and be generous," Clark says. "It's meant to be obvious." Since the goal is for the pink to stand out on your skin, opt for a crreamy formula, like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>MAC Cosmetics Cheeky Devil Glowplay Blush</a> or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Saie Dew Blush</a>, in a vivid color that's buildable and easily blends for a diffused look.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sweep the color across the bridge of the nose to get a defined yet natural flush. Then, using a fluffy eyeshadow brush, take that same shade through the crease of the eye and blend it in.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For a romantic monochromatic look, Clark recommends applying a soft-pink highlighter to the inner corner of the eyes to match your flush. Finally, make sure the pink on your lips also matches the pink you have defining the cheeks.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Pro tip: What you can do, especially if you have darker skin, is to DIY your own blush with a mid-tone pink lipstick. "Customize a cheek, eye, lip color using by mixing the lip color into a dab of foundation to create a soft, pink blush," she says. "Then, wrap that onto the eyes as well — and add that lip color to lips and blend it with lip liner."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Finally, set the look with translucent powder and apply a lengthening mascara for a dramatic curl on your lashes — and consider your coquette makeup look complete.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wqiorp2kqbJuucCknK6oXam%2FprrDZm5uaGhmf3I%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./abaca-resort-cebu.html><span>←</span><span>Abaca Resort, Cebu | South China Morning Post</span></a>
