Although we’re used to seeing death on-screen in Chicago Fire (from Leslie Shay to Otis Zvonecek) nothing prepares you for the loss of a real life.</p><p><a href=#>Chicago Fire</a>&nbsp;is NBC’s drama series following the personal and professional lives of firefighters, paramedics and other rescue personnel at the Chicago Fire Department’s fictional Firehouse 51. The series — which premiered in 2012 and is created by Dick Wolf, the same mind behind the&nbsp;Law & Order&nbsp;and&nbsp;FBI&nbsp;franchises — is the first show in NBC’s One Chicago franchise, which also includes&nbsp;Chicago P.D.&nbsp;and&nbsp;Chicago Med.&nbsp;</p><p>One Chicago, including the Chicago Fire family, prides itself on being extremely close – and the actors often refer to themselves as family. In an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>Entertainment Weekly&nbsp;</a>in February 2021, David Eigenberg (who plays veteran firefighter Christopher Herrmann) spoke about his coworkers in that very way. “We’re all like family. It’s been nearly 10 years that we’ve been working on the show, and we’ve developed a friendship over the years,” he said.</p><p>Following the <a href=#>devastating passing of Treat Williams</a> (Benny Severide) on June 12, 2023, we’re looking back at <a href=#>Chicago Fire cast deaths</a> and paying tribute to the lives lost.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=19.424805272618><h2>Treat Williams (Benny Severide)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Chicago-Fire-1.jpg><p>Treat Williams, who played Benny Williams on&nbsp;Chicago Fire, <a href=#>died in a motorcycle accident</a> on June 12, 2023.&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>People</a>&nbsp;first reported that Williams was killed in a motorcycle crash near Dorset, Vermont. His death was confirmed by his agent of 15 years, Barry McPherson.</p><p>Williams had a recurring role in&nbsp;Chicago Fire from 2013 to 2018. He played Lieutenant Kelly Severide’s father and a former firefighter who worked with Wallace Boden and Henry Mills. Williams first appeared in the Chicago-based drama in Season 1, Episode 13, “Warm and Dead.” Unfortunately, his character died from a massive stroke in Season 7, Episode 6, “All The Proof.” Kelly, his younger half-sister sister, Katie, and others from Firehouse 51 attended Benny’s funeral, as the Chicago Fire Department honored Benny for his services and Severide placed a medal that Katie found on his casket.</p><p>When the actor left Chicago Fire in 2018, he shared a photo alongside his costars, including Kinney, Miranda Rae Mao and Kim Delaney. “Finished my #ChicagoFire episodes. Miranda Rae Mayo, Taylor Kinney, Kim Delaney. Great actors all,” he&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>tweeted</a>&nbsp;in March 2018.</p><p>Taylor Kinney, who played Treat William’s on-screen son, Kelly Severide, on Chicago Fire, spoke to <a href=# rel=nofollow>People</a> after the news of William’s death. “My thoughts and prayers are with Treat’s family,’ Kinney wrote in an exclusive statement. “He played my father on&nbsp;Chicago Fire, and was a father figure to everyone on set. I’ll always relish our conversations and his uncanny ability to light up a room. We all send love, he will be missed,” Kinney continued.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=11.355889724311><h2>DuShon Monique Brown (Connie)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Treat-Williams-CF.jpg><p>From Seasons 1 to&nbsp;6,&nbsp;we frequently saw DuShon Monique Brown on&nbsp;Chicago Fire. She played the role of Connie, Chief Boden (Eamonn Walker)’s assistant. She appeared in 59 episodes between 2012 and 2018, but unfortunately, her character was written off after the actress’ sudden death. In March 2018, Brown passed away from sepsis, a blood infection of an unknown origin.&nbsp;</p><p>Chicago Fire&nbsp;producer Dick Wolf paid tribute to Brown after her passing. “The Chicago Fire family is devastated to lose one of its own,” he said in a statement. “Our thoughts and prayers are with DuShon’s family and we will all miss her.” As for writing Brown’s character out of the show, showrunner Derek Haas wanted it to be a tribute from the cast and crew. “I wrote it as what I wanted to say,” he told the&nbsp;<a href=#>Chicago Tribune</a>. “We didn’t get a chance to say goodbye, but she was loved.”&nbsp;</p><p>Her agent said that Brown was “a film, television, commercial and voice-over actress who also graced the stages of many Chicago theaters.” She also appeared in TV shows like&nbsp;Empire, Shameless, Boss, Prison Break&nbsp;and more. She was 49 years old.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=6.4036388140162><h2>Molly Glynn</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DuShon-Monique-Brown-.jpg><p>Molly Glynn, who played a doctor in three episodes of&nbsp;Chicago Fire, passed away in September 2014. As an ER doctor on the show, she treated injured patients that the Firehouse 51 team brought in. According to&nbsp;<a href=#>CBS</a>, Glynn was riding her bike with her husband, Joe Foust, in Chicago’s Erickson Woods when a tree fell and struck her. She was rushed to Evanston Hospital, but died from her injuries the next day.</p><p>Her husband wrote on <a href=# rel=nofollow>Facebook</a>: “Friends, this is the darkest day of my life,” he wrote. “Things will never be the same. Molly got hit by a falling tree while we were biking… Love hard, people. Love hard.” Glynn was also an accomplished theatre actress. She was 46 years old.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=9.8022355975924><h2>Tuesday the Dalmatian</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Molly-Glynn.jpg><p>Just a few days before the&nbsp;Chicago Fire&nbsp;Season 10 finale, an important member of the NBC drama’s cast passed away: Tuesday the Dalmatian.&nbsp;</p><p>Tuesday’s was Firehouse 51’s dog for more than four years. His trainer, Christine Mahaney, revealed the news in an <a href=#>Instagram post</a>. “As Tuesday’s trainer this may be the most difficult post I ever make. With the season 10 finale also comes Tuesday’s last episode on Chicago Fire. It breaks my heart to share that Tuesday passed away on Sunday, May 22, due to unforeseen kidney issues. The love from you, Tuesday’s fans, over the past 4 years has been immense,” she wrote.</p><p>Daniel Kyri, who plays firefighter candidate Darren Ritter on&nbsp;Chicago Fire, is the owner of Tuesday on the show. He wrote in an Instagram story that he was “heartbroken” about Tuesday’s passing, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>Penn Live</a>. “This is devastating. Tuesday was the cutest member of 51 and we all love her and always will. May she rest in peace,” he wrote. “She brought smiles to the faces of everyone who was lucky enough to meet her, thanks for sharing her with us Christine!”</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmoJmcobKzxY6cn6KbkZy8brLIq5xmm5GowW6wxJqroatf</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fchicago-fire-cast-deaths.html&text=Chicago%20Fire%20Cast%20Deaths%202023%2c%20One%20Chicago%20Actors%20Who%20Have%20Died%2c%20Passed&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fchicago-fire-cast-deaths.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fchicago-fire-cast-deaths.html&title=Chicago%20Fire%20Cast%20Deaths%202023%2c%20One%20Chicago%20Actors%20Who%20Have%20Died%2c%20Passed" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fchicago-fire-cast-deaths.html&title=Chicago%20Fire%20Cast%20Deaths%202023%2c%20One%20Chicago%20Actors%20Who%20Have%20Died%2c%20Passed" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fchicago-fire-cast-deaths.html&title=Chicago%20Fire%20Cast%20Deaths%202023%2c%20One%20Chicago%20Actors%20Who%20Have%20Died%2c%20Passed" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fchicago-fire-cast-deaths.html&description=Chicago%20Fire%20Cast%20Deaths%202023%2c%20One%20Chicago%20Actors%20Who%20Have%20Died%2c%20Passed" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./astaroth-bug-world-burns-issue-fix.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Diablo 4 Astaroth Bug, As the World Burns Issue Fix">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-peter-nygards-son-jessar-nygard-bio-age-mother-occupation-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Peter Nygrds son Jessar Nygard?
