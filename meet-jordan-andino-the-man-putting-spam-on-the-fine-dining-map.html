From his youthful looks, we can assume that the chef is in his early to mid-thirties.</p><p>Andino is very proud of his heritage and was born to his Filipino parents in Toronto, Canada, however, they moved soon after to Manhattan Beach, California where he was raised. Here is where he started working in the kitchen with his dad, who was a chef himself.</p><p>The talented chef began cooking from a young age and started self-training under the shadow of his father, here is where he learned to love his country’s traditional flavours.</p><p>In terms of his education and qualifications, Andino attended Cornell University’s School of Hotel Administration to improve upon his culinary skills. He clearly did just this as he is now one of the most noticeable faces in New York Cities’ culinary world.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Jordan Andino (@fork_knife)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=jordan-andinos-culinary-connection-with-spam>Jordan Andino’s culinary connection with S.P.A.M</h2><p>S.P.A.M tends to have a bad reputation across the US (and most places) but Jordan has started to change that ideology. The canned good is often used in Hawaiin and Filipino culture and the young chef grew up enjoying the salty snack in delicious meals.</p><p>During an interview with <a href=#>Forbes</a>, Andino announced that he had recently partnered with S.P.A.M with the hopes of popularizing and normalizing it across America by showing people the delicious meals that you can create with it if you use it correctly.</p><p>With his skills surrounding Filipino cuisine and his ability to fuse different flavours, Jordan plans to mix the food of his culture with Mexican cuisine and S.P.A.M to make things like his delicious cheesy S.P.A.M Pastor Tacos.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Jordan Andino (@fork_knife)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=jordan-has-had-a-successful-career-so-far>Jordan has had a successful career so far</h2><p>The young chef has achieved many things in his career so far and there are lots more to come. He is the owner and executive chef at his restaurant, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Flip Sigi</a> which is a Filipino Taqueria.
