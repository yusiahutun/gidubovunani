The swim bladder of a fish, it’s considered a delicacy in many Asian countries. To create a lab-grown version of croaker fish maws, scientists from Hong Kong-based Avant Meats place fish cells in a culture medium containing dozens of different nutrients, and store them in a bioreactor connected to an oxygen tank.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/01/10/35167f55-80fe-4088-96ad-c4e1816cfd8f_6ed07ba5.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Within weeks, those cells proliferate into tissues the size of a grain of rice, at which point they’re ready for assembly into larger pieces.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The science behind cultivated meat isn’t new – cell cultures were first used in medical research in 1907 – but applying that idea to meat gained traction after a Dutch pharmacologist presented the world’s first cell-based in-vitro hamburger on television in 2013.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Today, more than 100 companies around the world are trying to create cell-based protein, ranging from lab-grown lamb to lab-grown oysters, and even lab-grown foie gras.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">More peas, please: bowel cancer risk for men lower on a plant-based diet</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Different proteins present different complications, though: makers of cell-based seafood, for example, don’t have the advantage medical research gives those cultivating mammalian cells.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And meats made up of more complex tissue and texture can be more difficult to construct – a process known as “scaffolding” that holds together muscle, fat and connective tissue to recreate meat’s structure.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">How is cultivated meat different from plant-based meat?</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Plant-based meat refers to “meat” that is made from soy or other non-meat ingredients – Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat are two of the more high-profile companies producing plant-based meat products.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Cultivated meat, on the other hand, is produced by cultivating animal cells directly. It has the exact same nutrition as conventionally produced beef, pork, poultry and seafood – though both plant-based and cell-based meats are still perfecting the taste and texture.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The other big difference between plant-based and cultivated protein is availability. Plant-based meat is still struggling to reach consistent price parity with regular meat – and commands less than 1 per cent of the global market, according to an estimate from the Good Food Institute Asia Pacific – but it is sold in restaurants and grocery stores around the world.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/01/10/7faf2fdb-1005-4305-9e28-2f1e226a17c6_595de0ff.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For now, the commercial sale of lab-grown meat is only legal in Singapore, a city state of 5.5 million that is focused on dramatically reducing its reliance on food imports.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Experts say that’s unlikely to change any time soon. Scaling up the production of cultivated protein from a pilot stage to a commercial level requires technological advances, industry observers say, and massive bioreactors required for mass manufacturing don’t exist yet.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Regulatory hurdles also remain. In the US, the Food and Drug Administration recently told Upside Foods that it had no questions about the safety of the company’s cell-based chicken for human consumption, but the California-based start-up still needs more approvals, including from the US Department of Agriculture, which jointly oversees the roll-out of cultivated meat.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Elsewhere, policymakers in China, Israel and the Netherlands have signalled support for cell-based meat, but none have approved commercial sales.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Can vegetarians eat cultivated meat?</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Technically, cultivated meat is not vegan or even vegetarian: it’s made from growing cells taken from real animals.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But people become vegetarians for different reasons, ranging from concerns over animal rights to fears about the use of antibiotics and hormones in livestock.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Many vegetarians avoid meat in an effort to keep from exhausting environmental resources. On some of these fronts, cell-based meat might be a viable alternative.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“If you believe that taking anything from an animal, including a cell, is exploitative, then you won’t be [eating cultivated meat],” says Sonalie Figueiras, founder of sustainability website Green Queen.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“But if your focus is more on reducing the overall impact of [animal] suffering, then you would probably eat it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/01/10/c48bbf57-58e6-4513-b706-cd019d581c72_ec981fda.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Is cultivated protein better for the environment?</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Cell-based meat can play a vital role in helping restore biodiversity, which has long been threatened by traditional agriculture. Consider, for example, that clearing land for cattle ranching is responsible for about 80 per cent of deforestation in the Amazon.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But when it comes to the climate impact of cultivated protein, the answer isn’t entirely straightforward.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Growing meat from cells in bioreactors does use far less land than traditional farming, and avoids a lot of the emissions associated with, for example, cow burps. It could also allow companies to produce meat closer to their consumers, reducing the amount of fuel needed to deliver foodstuffs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/01/10/ada280f1-22a9-4f68-bd2f-496757a4d073_1638767f.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But growing meat in bioreactors demands significant amounts of electricity, particularly at scale. That makes cultivated pork and chicken a viable option to reduce emissions only if its production is powered by wind, solar and other renewable energy sources, according to one 2021 study by Dutch environmental consultancy CE Delft.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The same study found that cell-based beef, on the other hand, can achieve more climate gains than its farmed counterpart no matter what kind of power is used to make it, because conventional cattle ranching is so resource-intensive.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">What’s ‘wrong’ with cultivated protein?</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Most doubts about cultivated protein have to do with its limitations: for now, it’s still highly expensive to produce, which makes widespread sales – even with regulatory approval – difficult to imagine any time soon.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Indeed, nearly a decade after the world’s first cultivated in-vitro burger was created at a phenomenal cost of US$325,000, the only commercially available cultivated meat is sold in small amounts in Singapore and made by San Francisco-based Eat Just.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The company says it will take eight years for its products to become cost-competitive with conventional meat.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Transparency has also been a point of contention. Jaydee Hanson, a policy director at the Washington-based non-profit Centre for Food Safety, says makers of cultivated protein rarely disclose how they keep the cells growing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/01/10/5a7f31c6-b3a1-482d-a7a6-09aa91c0cede_e17d1928.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">That can sometimes expose problematic processes and raise new questions about ethicality, like for example the use of the blood of unborn calves as a medium for cell culture. (Some cultivated protein companies, however, are making efforts to ditch all production materials of animal origin.)</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Then there’s the more everyday but equally important challenges: appearance, texture and taste.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On a November night at the Four Seasons in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, a dozen COP27 attendees dined on grilled chicken thigh with mushroom rice, a dish made using Eat Just’s cell-based chicken. The entrée was met with mixed results.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s got the look [of chicken],” one guest said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I can definitely tell it’s not chicken,” noted another. “It’s too smooth.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOwu8Nmm6uhnqB8or7TopqlnV9of3GCkWxnaKSRl3qovs6wpWallZbBbrXTZqqanpVitrV51Z6enqyRp7aiuoywn56mXay2rbiMoqtmmpVirretyKWYm6SVYra1ecGeq62domKyr8LIq6anpZWjwW6ty6VksqelYrumscM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./erykah-badu-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Erykah Badu Net Worth: Daughters: Kids Father</span></a>
