class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Opinion polls show Macron scoring 59 per cent to 41 per cent for Le Pen in Sunday’s vote, but previous debates during the rollercoaster French campaign have quickly shifted public opinion.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Macron rebutted many of Le Pen’s attacks in the opening hour, saying her proposals would have to be financed by borrowing or by raising taxes -- what he called “a hidden programme”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Le Pen hit back that while she would protect state assets and increase people’s spending power, Macron would sell off French state companies to foreign buyers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“In my vision, everything is not for sale, everything cannot be bought,” she said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The debate marks a new step into the mainstream for Le Pen, whose party was once considered by France’s political establishment to be an extremist fringe that should be boycotted.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When Jean-Marie Le Pen made it into the final round of the presidential election in 2002, his conservative opponent Jacques Chirac refused to debate with him out of fear of “normalising hate and intolerance”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Fifteen years later, Le Pen scored 21.3 per cent in the first round of the French election on April 23 after softening the FN’s image -- but without fully removing doubt about the party’s core beliefs.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The debate was her biggest chance in front of a live television audience of millions to impress undecided voters.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Socialist President Francois Hollande and members of the government have led warnings about the risk of a Le Pen presidency, with around a third of voters set to abstain, according to pollsters’ predictions.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We are in a zone of absolute danger,” warned Education Minister Najat Vallaud-Belkacem before the debate. “Do not play Russian roulette with our democracy.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hollande told reporters that “we shouldn’t think the result is a foregone conclusion” and urged Macron, his former advisor and economy minister, to make clear his different vision of France in Europe and the world.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Macron quit the government last August to concentrate on his new centrist political movement En Marche, which has drawn 250,000 members in 12 months.</p><img

class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Macron is expected to home in on uncertainty about Le Pen’s pledge to withdraw France from the euro common currency.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The policy is seen as risky and is unpopular with most voters.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Macron would do well to put maximum emphasis on the EU issue in the debate, especially the currency,” veteran political analyst Philippe Braud said. “It’s the issue that causes the most concern, especially for businesses.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Le Pen said Sunday that a new franc would be introduced for daily use while the euro would be retained for “large companies that trade internationally”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The franc to buy your baguette and the euro for multinationals... it’s not so much backtracking but a smokescreen in the last days of the campaign,” wrote journalist Jacques-Olivier Martin in newspaper Le Figaro on Wednesday.</p><p class=postsid
