She also has a role on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>The Client List</a> and upcoming films Transit and Officer Down out later this year.

Three weeks in, are you keeping it? Let Elisabeth know in the comments.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So here we are at the start of 2012 and I’m sure each of us has a mile-long list of things we would do differently from last year. Perhaps little things make the top 20, but there’s always the BIG one that stands out from the rest.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We know that if we at least tackle that one thing, all will be set straight in our universe. One is totally doable, right? With <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>our harried schedules</a>, it seems realistic to say that there would be one big game-changer that we could focus on this year.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I had mine all lined up and picked out earlier this month. I was ready to put it into motion until … dun dun dun! It came to my attention that I may have picked the wrong New Year’s resolution.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Perhaps a few people over the year had pointed out that there was another matter worthy of my consideration. But I hadn’t really paid it any mind — although I’ll admit it had nagged at me. But when you hear something a few times over and over, I guess one could say that it might become a more imperative matter.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I mean c’mon, you know something is urgent when loved ones are handing out a New Year’s resolution to you!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So here it is. I shudder to say it out loud, PEOPLE.com, but I knew it was true when the last and final person (my trying-to-be-sensitive-but-not-quite-achieving-it <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>other half</a>) said it. Ron told me that I wear too many “mom clothes.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I mean, it kind of sucked when he compared me to an aging woman in ballet slippers and a cardigan who attended our recent New Year’s brunch. But sadly, I’ll admit that we did look an awful lot alike.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Now, just to set the record straight — I thought she looked good, the middle-aged lady that he whispered about in between his bites of fruit and yogurt (he turned over his new leaf a few months ago). So now he’s in the business of advising others on how to improve their lives and stay young?!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I mean, I’ve always leaned towards the preppy look rather than, let’s say, the <strong><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Fergie</a></strong>-esque get up and dance look, although I appreciate it in others. In fact, I really admire those women who continue to sex it up a little for the duration of their lives. I certainly thought I’d be one of those types, because I come from a long line of women who have stayed youthful and attractive as the years have unmercifully gone by.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Now, let me make something clear: I like the preppy look and by saying that I’m preppy, I did not think I’d lost my edge … that’s just my style preference. I’ve always <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>leaned towards the classic little black dress</a>. To tell the truth, I really like ballet slippers!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, I had noticed that something changed in my wardrobe choices, starting three years ago. I’ve even <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>blogged about it before</a>. You know … the sensible breastfeeding blouse, the pants that have added stretch, and the low shoes with all that extra support.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I started to go for practicality and comfort rather than style and expression. It happens. We all talk about it. We even laugh about it, as if we are proud to wear our badge of mom honor by displaying those too long sweaters that resemble tents, rather the fitted ones of the past. But I think I may have gone too far, perhaps over the edge into the tacky shoes department.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-table mntl-sc-block-table" readability=38.950542822678><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As I watched the woman with her ponytail (no time to blow it out), ballet slippers (there used to be long legs there), cardigan and leggings (all black, square and flowing as to hide any lumps and bumps), I hated to admit that Ron was right.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Not to mention that I kind of wanted to plunge my butter knife into him as he plunged my ego into that cold glass of water. Deep inside I knew it was true, although I became grumpy for the rest of the day.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Even now, as I step away from the computer to look at myself in the mirror, my hair is still in that ponytail due to the lack of a current blowout. I’m in some sort of plastic ballet slippers that really aren’t cool and that I never would have worn four years ago, before Easton was conceived.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I remember looking at those sexy as heck (even my language has changed!) photo shoots I’d see in Vogue, with some statuesque model in three-inch heels and a tight suit pushing a baby stroller with her hair flowing in the wind and sunglasses on. You know, like <strong><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Victoria Beckham</a></strong>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I was so sure that would be the type of mom look I’d duplicate once I had a little bundle of joy. Okay yes, for those events that come up, I still <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>know how to pull out those punches</a>. However, I had no idea my inner <strong>Martha Stewart</strong> would start showing up on a daily basis.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I mean, for goodness sake, I’m in a plaid ruffled shirt right now because it was a gift and not because I like it. It doesn’t even look particularly bad, but it doesn’t look good either. In fact, it looks like a tablecloth.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The other day my <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>gorgeous friend</a> — a parent who is just spectacularly stylish — was lamenting her ballet slippers too, and saying she was going to buy herself some new boots with a heel to go to the office in. I was applauding her. All the while, I was wearing some strange non-youthful getup of my own as we perused the web for her sexy new shoes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Where have I stashed <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>my former self</a>?” I was thinking yesterday as I ate my bagel with too much cream cheese (yes, part of my mom getup is some extra poundage — I’m going to shed that too).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I watched the older woman that Ron was comparing me to nibbling on her breakfast and thought, “Ugh!” It’s like that last cigarette you smoke. The final straw had broken. I wasn’t going to be compared to someone 20 years my senior — no way.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I made a commitment to myself today as I threw on my usual gear with distraction that this would be the last day that I’d let my youth faintly slip away. So my New Year’s resolution this January is to burn my mom costume in the back yard and blow the dust off some of my other old relics from those days gone by, at least until I can afford a few new things!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This year, let’s focus the blog a little bit more on us, ladies. I have a few tricks up my sleeve to help us all get that shiny look of youth back in our cheeks and trust me, we won’t have to break an ankle doing it by trying to look like <strong><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Beyoncé</a></strong>!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Not to mention she’s probably going to have to wear some ballet slippers and sensible shirts soon herself with that new baby girl. Don’t worry Beyoncé, we’ll be there for you when you want to get your fashion groove back too!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Tell me your own personal New Year’s resolutions (and are you keeping them thus far?).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Until next time, PEOPLE.com.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">— Elisabeth Röhm</p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6CWv6a606xmnqSZqK6jsdOhZKunmKLAbq7LqJ5mppWserqxwKuqZqqVqLytwdOipqdlnqR6rrvRnmSmp51isK2706GcrGc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./meaning-of-darkside-by-blink-182.html><span>←</span><span>Meaning of Darkside by Blink-182</span></a>
