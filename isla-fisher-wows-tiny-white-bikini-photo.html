The couple is very private about their home life, but Isla has shared snippets of her routine with her children in the past.</p><p id=eUdhziIQGZy data-wc=47>In an interview in 2021 with <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Australia's Women's Weekly</a>, she shared a candid look at family life behind closed doors. "One of the perks of being an actor is you have a bunch of silly voices in your back pocket to whip out at bedtime," she said.&nbsp;</p><p id=eVRmKhplHIw data-wc=45>She also revealed that she adores reading to her brood, adding: "There's often a teachable lesson that leads to interesting discussions. If somebody is having a problem at school or something, I'll tailor the bedtime story a little bit to align with whatever's going on."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2875e2ec8a11-isla-fisher-husband-sacha-baron-cohen.jpg><p id=eLhcQO3uED data-wc=32>Isla and Sacha have been together for almost 23 years after meeting in 2001 at a "pretentious party" in Sydney. They got engaged in 2004 and married six years later in Paris.&nbsp;</p><p id=ez-y1Anx1qS data-wc=49>Sacha previously told the New York Times&nbsp;that they had bonded over "taking the mick out of the other people in the party". He said it was love at first sight for him as he found Isla "hilarious," although he thinks she took more convincing of their future together.&nbsp;</p><p id=e7JxZQKB0Gp data-wc=19>"I knew instantly," he said. "I don't know if she did. It's taken her about 20 years to know."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/225462050af4-isla-fisher-with-dad-z.jpg><p id=eArbpOnnT7 data-wc=51>With the holiday season fast approaching, it will no doubt be a difficult time for Isla as it will mark her first since the death of her beloved father, Brian. Back in January, she announced his passing on Instagram with an emotional message alongside several touching photos of the pair together.&nbsp;</p><p id=ezLuQ_SrVQ data-wc=32><strong>"How do you live without someone that you can't live without? How lucky am I to have had you as my dad. You were hilarious, positive and my best friend,"</strong> she began.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/fbee92285107-isla-fisher-dad-z.jpg><p id=ecXJmBI0Or3 data-wc=44>"No matter what was going in my life on you always asked me if I was having fun," Isla continued. "I know this pain is going to get worse as the days between when I last saw you increase and that is very scary.</p><p id=eybmEDDKAA data-wc=16>"I love you so much.
