Because it’s so unique (more on that later), finding brands like Reformation can be tricky. Let’s illuminate the reasons why people love Reformation.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Firstly, its dresses, shoes, and separates are A-lister-approved: Gigi Hadid, Katie Holmes, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Hailey Bieber shop the label</a>. Taylor Swift might even be <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>considered a super fan</a>! Beyond the pull of its star-studded clientele, Reformation is cool in a way that’s hard to define and even harder to replicate. It makes classic but trend-aware clothes that last—and does so with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>a focus on sustainability</a>. Reformation clothes feel luxurious without a luxury price tag. While we wouldn’t call it a budget brand, it delivers on quality. So, while you might spend $200 on a pair of trousers, you’ll likely not have to drop a dime on that specific staple for years to come.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_4-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Whether you’re a Reformation girlie who runs on vibes alone or wants to get the most fashion bang for your buck, you’ll love how the nine brands ahead evoke Reformation's winning formula.&nbsp;<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-quince></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Quince</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Quince</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Quince is known for its high-quality wardrobe staples made from high-quality materials minus the high markup. Quince’s direct-to-consumer model cuts costs on the backend so you can snag a gorgeous cashmere sweater&nbsp;for under $80 or a classic leather moto jacket for only $150. In terms of bang relative to buck, you won't find a more affordable option in this roundup, especially the brand's sophisticated silk separates and classic <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>business casual attire</a>. While Quince does deliver trendy silhouettes, its vibe is more quiet luxury than in-your-face flash so you won't find any sequin-spangled mini skirts or loud prints among its offerings.</p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-groupcallout__title>Our Quince Picks</h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Quince offers many eco-friendly fabric options and highlights <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>its factory-selection process</a>, only working with factories that "meet or exceed global guidelines for workplace safety and equitable wages," it doesn't provide explicit details. The same goes for its sustainability efforts, although the brand clearly states it is aiming to have 100% compostable product packaging soon.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-staud></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Staud</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy of Staud</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Luxe and playful, Staud layers an elevated whimsy over the Reformation aesthetic. The brand is decidedly contemporary, but its pieces have an old world (or old money) confidence so that its mini dresses, separates, statement bags, and outerwear feel trendy yet timeless.</p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-groupcallout__title>Our Staud Picks</h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While Staud has plenty of quiet luxury pieces available, the brand goes the extra mile when marrying classic silhouettes with clever embellishments. A ribbon spaghetti strap, a crystal constellation set upon a beaded night sky mini dress, a streak of silver paillettes on a chunky knit sweater—these are the details that make Staud stand out. With the luxe whimsy, however, comes a luxe price tag and Staud is the priciest brand on our list.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-madewell></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Madewell</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Madewell</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you want the timeless feel of Reformation at a more affordable price point, make moves to Madewell. Its blazers, sweaters, and jeans are cult faves thanks to unmatched fit and quality. Out of all the brands similar to Reformation, Madewell makes the most effort when it comes to inclusive sizing options. Madewell's plus collection offers sizes 14W–28W and 1X–4X, with plans to further expand the range.</p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-groupcallout__title>Our Madewell Picks</h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Although Madewell doesn't have Reformation's level of transparency when it comes to sustainability and worker rights, it is upfront about its goals and keeps track of its progress. Many of its initiatives <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>emphasize recycling</a> as a means to limit landfill waste and it currently offers a range of textiles <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>made with recycled fibers</a>. Madewell aims to be carbon neutral by 2030.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-szane></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Sézane</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sézane</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Reformation: French Girl edition. That's the vibe of Sézane, a sophisticated and sumptuous brand that wears <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>its commitment to sustainability</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>ethical production</a> on its velvet sleeve. Sézane's online store has the warm glow and cultured vibes of a Parisian boutique: Everything it offers, from mini skirts to blazers feels elevated and one-of-a-kind. Despite its luxe feel, Sézane isn't the priciest brand in our roundup. In fact, it's on par with Reformation in terms of cost.</p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-groupcallout__title>Our Sézane Picks</h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Its production and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>sustainability transparency</a> are shoulder-to-shoulder with Reformation as well. B-Corp certified, many of Sézane's fabrics, which are 80% eco-friendly, also boast notable certifications, including GOTS, Oeko-Tex, FSC, Ecovero, RWS, and RMS. Its <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>official sustainability report</a> is available online. As a slow fashion brand, it is upfront about its factories and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>provides details</a> on each Sézane atelier around the world, including what it produces.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-marcella-nyc></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Marcella NYC</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Marcella</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Thanks to its sleek silhouettes and timeless wardrobe staples with off-duty model toughness, you could build an entire NYC-approved wardrobe sourced exclusively from Marcella NYC. From slinky maxi dresses to chunky cable knits and boleros A-List fashion girlies would drool over, if you feel like your metropolitan capsule collection is missing something, Marcella's got it. Even better, its prices are among the most affordable on our list, not due to lesser quality, but rather the brand's commitment to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>democratizing fashion</a> by keeping prices between 25% and 75% lower than comparable brands.</p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-groupcallout__title>Our Marcella Picks</h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Marcella is also committed to providing its production teams, predominately women-led and operated, with living wages. In terms of sustainability, Marcella credits <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>its speedy production cycle</a> with reducing waste and keeping its products out of landfills.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-allina-liu></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Allina Liu</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Allina Lui</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">None of the brands on this list nail Reformation's modern approach to romance and femininity quite like Allina Liu. The eponymous label was launched by Liu in 2015, after she'd worked as a designer with brands like The Row, Thakoon, and Rebecca Taylor. Like some of Reformation's best pieces, Allina Liu's luxe creations deliver a kind of trendy anachronism, managing to feel both sumptuously vintage and TikTok trend-worthy at once.<br></p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-groupcallout__title>Our Allina Liu Picks</h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for its ethics, Allina Liu never uses fur or leather and utilizes some sustainable fabrics, including the brand's cotton blended with recycled materials. The brand is transparent about <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>its production cycle </a>and is both WRAP and BSCI-certified.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-posse-the-label></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Posse the Label</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Posse the Label</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We like to think of Posse the Label as Reformation's distant European cousin. They share mood boards, but you won't see them in the same 'fit at family gatherings. Posse's airy dresses and dreamy separates radiate sophisticated beauty, but quietly so. Cold weather climate-dwellers might find the majority of its clothes to be a bit lightweight, but the brand does offer long-sleeve and knit options, many hovering between $150 and $300.</p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-groupcallout__title>Our Posse Picks</h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While its aesthetic is as gauzy and low-fi as a vintage Snapchat filter, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Posse's ethical framework</a> is crystal clear and crisply defined. It outlines its commitments to fair labor, sustainable materials, and a cyclical production cycle on its website. Like Reformation, Posse has its <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>factory certifications</a>, packaging, and textile information readily available. The brand also emphasizes giving back. Its partners include i=change, Worn for Good, Thread Together, and The Archives Place.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-ralisation-par></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Réalisation Par</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Réalisation Par</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Réalisation Par's aesthetic is equal parts '90s alt-rock femme fatale and Gen Z It Girl. If you're a fan of vampy slip dresses or maxi skirts, sheer layers, and vintage-inspired prints, you'll fall head-over-heels in love with Réalisation Par's effortless and edgy vibe.</p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-groupcallout__title>Our Réalisation Par Picks</h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While the brand emphasizes <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>its commitment to sustainability</a> and ethical production, it doesn't provide much transparency into its practices. That said, Réalisation Par isn't churning out its clothes. A glance at its online store reveals a carefully curated and relatively small array of apparel, typical of brands operating outside the fast fashion machine.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-maje></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Maje</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Maje</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While Maje's prices skew towards the higher end of the spectrum, this brand's blend of trendy statement pieces and wardrobe staples makes it a Reformation twin flame. If you find yourself wishing that your favorite Reformation piece was just a little bit extra, you'll love the quirky, but polished sequin, teddy, and metallic textiles found in Maje designs.</p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-groupcallout__title>Our Maje Picks</h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Like many of the brands on this list, Maje has committed to becoming more sustainable, as outlined in its <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Dream Tomorrow commitment</a>. Currently, Maje's denim is 100% waterless, its packaging is made from recycled materials, and many, though not all, of its textiles are made from responsibly sourced materials. As of 2022, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>60% of the brand's factories</a> have gained social and environmental certifications.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wauYp5yjYrmqt8RmqZ6en6e6osDIqKVmcGRlfniEjw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./best-gift-cards.html><span>←</span><span>40 Best Gift Cards for Women in 2023</span></a>
