"Hallelujah, Amen and about damn time," she exclaimed.</p><p>"It's been a helluva year," added the star, who -- in addition to weathering a worldwide pandemic and never-ending election -- also handled her own "entanglement" scandal.

A lot of pain, but great gains."</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">If the embedded video below doesn't work, you can also watch the episode here.&nbsp;</a></p><p>She then turned her attention to her daughter. "You really stepped into your womanhood this year and you showed the world your transformation during your Fenty strut," she told her.</p><p>The 20-year-old was one of the many stars who took part in <a href=#>Rihanna's</a> Savage X Fenty runway show for her lingerie line this year, something Willow admitted she had doubts about before hitting the catwalk.</p><p>"As soon as I got in there, I was like, 'Oh god, maybe I can't handle this. Maybe this is not my place,'" she recalled. "That comes from my insecurity. I put on the clothes, I looked at myself and said, 'You're gonna go out there and vibe it out.'"</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:77ca044f-aaba-4e72-b26a-1ffeed2ee769 data-container-ref=toofab:article:d94f007c-0ebd-49b9-838b-f5004e17d003 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/0b/5by4/2020/11/19/0b4ee64dbdb8457b827f5c00eeb984c2_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Facebook</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Will Smith Cries as Janet Hubert Details Fresh Prince Mistreatment on Special Red Table Talk</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Jada explained Willow FaceTimed her during one of her fittings and knew which lingerie her daughter would be wearing for the main event. While her mom was excited about her looks, Willow wasn't sure how she'd feel about it -- because she'd never worn anything like it before.</p><p>"I was very surprised. I had never worn lingerie in my entire life. My first time wearing lingerie, ever," she explained. "I felt so empowered. I want to continue to get more confident and getting more comfortable in my skin."</p><p>Added Jada, "I'm proud of the young woman you're becoming."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:0ac1113b-4002-4d44-94e7-f369aa8a3b82 data-container-ref=toofab:article:d94f007c-0ebd-49b9-838b-f5004e17d003 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/3e/5by4/2020/11/13/3e88c7c8d88b489b8695f0fe01022331_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Facebook</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Jameela Jamil Tells Jada Pinkett Smith This Rumor Made Her Less of a Fan</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>The rest of the episode was what Jada called a "parade of hope," as the women welcomed a group of six guests who had lost a combined 1,000 pounds.</p><p>One of them, a man named Pierce Austin, has been part of the Smith family's inner circle for over 25 years, working as Will's barber for all of the actor's biggest projects.
