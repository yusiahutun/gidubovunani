In late August, <a href=# rel=dofollow>Elvis Presley</a> and <a href=# rel=dofollow>Priscilla Presley</a>‘s iconic 1960s Delta mobile home hit the auction block in <a href=# rel=dofollow>GWS Auctions’ “Legends: Iconic Film & Music Memorabilia Auction”</a> — and now we know that the home has been sold for more than $67,000!&nbsp;</p><p>A man named Max Wiggins from Kemah, TX paid $67,650 — though he said he “would have paid any price for it because it belonged to Elvis” — for the 60 feet long and 12 feet wide mobile home once owned by Elvis and Priscilla, 73. Just before it went up for auction, the two bedroom abode had been restored to the condition the couple left it in, which included a lavish gold sink and bathtub.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/elvis-presley-mobile-home.jpg><p>The late <a href=# rel=dofollow>King of Rock and Roll and his then wife</a> previously used the mobile home as a vacation getaway and placed it on the 163-acre grounds of their <a href=# rel=dofollow>famous Circle G Ranch</a>, which is located 10 miles south of Graceland in Horn Lake, MS. Elvis and Priscilla purchased the ranch in the 1960s and spent part of their honeymoon there after tying the knot in May 1967.&nbsp;</p><p>Since it is thought that Elvis spent many of his happiest years at Circle G Ranch and in his Delta mobile home, buyer Wiggins now plans to return the house trailer to Mississippi so fans can enjoy it. He also hopes to turn it into an Elvis exhibit and possibly make it available for fans to rent for special occasions.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/elvis-presley-mobile-home-2.jpg><p>The <a href=# rel=dofollow>online GWS Auctions posting</a> for Elvis and Priscilla’s iconic mobile home explained that the buyer would also receive the original paperwork from the property’s purchase, including “a notarized bill of sale dated 1967 which was signed by Elvis himself, State of Tennessee Department of Revenue slip with Elvis’ and the Circle G Ranch name, and mobile home sales contract.” What an awesome piece of music history to own!&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46eo6%2Bho2K9s7HSpZyyZaCntrSvyKWjmmWgp7K0uMSyZKankp65pnnHqKSeZaOkuaV5kG9scGtjZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./blake-lively-uses-gwyneth-paltrow-expert-witness-parody-ad.html><span>←</span><span>Blake Lively Uses Gwyneth Paltrow's Expert Witness In Parody Ad</span></a>
