He grew up in Davenport’s West End.</p><p>His family’s home was located at 2041 W. Fifth St. and in about 1933, his father opened a grocery store a block away on the northwest corner of Fourth and Cedar streets, according to the Davenport, Iowa history page on Facebook.</p><p>“Bill attended Frank L. Smart Intermediate School where he enjoyed hamming it up in front of an audience,” the bio says. He graduated from Davenport High in 1943, where he served as senior class president and worked on the yearbook staff as the picture editor.</p><p>He was involved in various dramatic presentations, plays, comedy skits, playing emcee, etc., and is even pictured in the yearbook “in drag” clowning around during the homecoming.</p><p><strong>A teenage cub reporter</strong></p><p>By 1944, Bill had already landed a newspaper reporter’s job working for the Davenport Democrat and Leader. Wundram would go on to serve in the newspaper business for 70-plus years, much of the time as the Quad-City Times’ featured columnist.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2023/02/BW2.jpg><p>For many years, he was the only known columnist in America who wrote seven days a week. Over his career, he held positions as city editor, associate editor, Sunday editor and lifestyles editor.</p><p>Wundram was named Master Columnist by the Iowa Press Association, and as a reporter/writer he covered both popes and presidents, dating back to Iowa’s own Herbert Hoover.</p><p><strong>A huge QC champion</strong></p><p>He was one of the QC’s biggest cheerleaders, and in 1989, he became a charter member of the board of directors when the Hall of Honors was founded at Davenport Central High School.</p><p>Wundram, along with the mayor of Davenport and a musician, were the three organizers of the <a href=#>Bix Beiderbecke Memorial Jazz Society</a>, and its nationally known Bix jazz concerts.</p><h2 class=inline-related-stories__heading>4 MORE</h2><ul class=inline-related-stories__list><li class=inline-related-stories__story><h3 class=article-list__article-title><a href=# class=article-list__article-link data-link-type=content-link data-link-position=1 data-link-pinned=false data-link-label="With Walt Disney Co. turning 100 this year, dress for your Disneyland trip in style with these items">With Walt Disney Co. turning 100 this year, dress&nbsp;…</a></h3></li><li class=inline-related-stories__story><h3 class=article-list__article-title><a href=# class=article-list__article-link data-link-type=content-link data-link-position=1 data-link-pinned=false data-link-label="Walt Disney’s Quad Cities connection">Walt Disney’s Quad Cities connection</a></h3></li><li class=inline-related-stories__story><h3 class=article-list__article-title><a href=# class=article-list__article-link data-link-type=content-link data-link-position=1 data-link-pinned=false data-link-label="Davenport Junior Theatre removes another barrier">Davenport Junior Theatre removes another barrier</a></h3></li><li class=inline-related-stories__story><h3 class=article-list__article-title><a href=# class=article-list__article-link data-link-type=content-link data-link-position=1 data-link-pinned=false data-link-label="A new taste sensation is open in downtown Davenport">A new taste sensation is open in downtown Davenport</a></h3></li></ul><p>For 17 years, he was the chairman of Davenport’s Halloween Mardi Gras. He was the organizer and chairman of the first professional division of the QC United Way and he formed the Midwest’s first version of Friends of the Library and served as its president.</p><p>When Scott County had no effective handle on its homeless pet problem, he and several lawyers and do-gooders formed the Scott County Humane Society, the Facebook bio says. Wundram has been president of the Friends of Art, chairman of the Beaux Arts Ball and Grand Gallery Ball.</p><p><strong>A Disney story</strong><strong></strong></p><p>One of his biggest interviews was with <a href=#>THE Walt Disney</a> (a longtime idol of Wundram), in 1965, who nearly settled in Davenport.</p><p>A man from Disney’s office offered to fly Wundram to California for a column. The company sent its private jet to the Quad City International Airport to pick up Wundram and his wife, according to a <a href=#>2016 interview with Local 4.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2023/02/BW3.png><p>Once they arrived, he was taken to Disney’s office in Burbank.</p><p>“It was like a big beautiful living room and there he was plinking around at the piano,” Wundram said then. “I said, ‘Mr. Disney, why me from Davenport?’”</p><p>“One time I applied for a job in Davenport, Iowa,” Wundram recalled the response from Disney.&nbsp;“I can’t remember the name of the company, but I think it was something like Victor. They made slides and they needed an artist and after going through all my stuff, they told me my artwork wasn’t any good.”</p><p>However, Disney went on to tell Wundram the company did offer him a job selling movie projectors — an offer Disney declined. <a href=#>Victor Animatograph Corp</a>. was founded in Davenport in 1910 by Alexander Victor.</p><p>Disney added one more thing before Wundram left the Burbank office.</p><p>“He said,&nbsp;‘Davenport is a very sweet town. You know, if I had taken that job, I could still be there today,’” Wundram recalled.</p><p>Disney died the next year, Dec. 15, 1966, at age 65.</p><p><strong>Love for the circus</strong></p><p>A well-known passion of Wundram was the circus. During his career, he made countless stops to interview performers with various circuses, capturing their lives under the real or proverbial big top.</p><p>During the roast and celebration of Wundram for his 60th anniversary with the Quad-City Times, he was presented with a “Guest Clown For Life” award from Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2023/02/Toto-Wundram.jpg><p>A statue of Wundram appears at the corner of Davenport’s 4th Street and River Drive outside of the Quad-City Times building in what is known as Bix Plaza.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2023/02/Screenshot_20230214-161837_Photos.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46lppyZnGK7psPSaJqopZ2qu6rA2GaqmrGjYrSwu8ObsJ5lpKR6sq%2FAZqOen5WjsW6uyKWjZq%2Blo7Gzrcxo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./made-to-order-what-it-takes-to-design-a-zuhair-murad-couture-gown.html><span>←</span><span>What It Takes to Design a Zuhair Murad Couture Gown</span></a>
