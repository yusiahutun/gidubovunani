What is Baby Keem’s real name?</p><h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2><p>Baby Keem is a rapper who is also known as the cousin of Kendrick Lamar, the Grammy-winning American rapper.</p><p>Keem gained popularity with the release of his tracks “Orange Soda” and “Honest” in 2019, both of which are included in his second mixtape, Die for My Bitch.</p><p>He has since collaborated with renowned artists in the industry, such as his cousin Kendrick Lamar, Kanye West, and Travis Scott.</p><h2><strong>The Origin Story</strong></h2><p>Baby Keem was born on October 22, 2000, in Carson, California, as Hykeem Jamaal Carter Jr.&nbsp;</p><p>He and his family eventually settled in Las Vegas, Nevada, where he spent most of his childhood.</p><p>His father, Hakeem Jamaal Carter Sr., also showed an interest in music, a pastime that runs in the Carter family.</p><p>He spent most of his youth living with his grandmother, whom he frequently mentions in his music. Her influence undoubtedly had a significant impact on him, as he later purchased a home for her.</p><p>He has alluded to having a humble upbringing.</p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-45487 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Baby-Keem-height.jpg.webp alt="Baby Keem height" width=1200 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Baby-Keem-height.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-1 data-svg=1 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-45487 class=wp-caption-text>@Getty</p><p>In a 2021 <a href=# rel=noopener>interview</a> with Billboard, Keem revealed that he and his family had a designated day to visit Goodwill and rummage through boxes of discarded clothing for pieces to wear. He said, “I’ve seen it all, and it’s important for me to talk about that rather than trying to run away from it.”</p><p>Despite any hardships Keem endured, he persisted in achieving his goals.</p><p>Additionally, Keem has said his cousins and uncle, who were also rappers, encouraged him to pursue a career in music. However, it wasn’t until he received a modest recording setup from his grandmother when he was fifteen that he felt confident enough to begin honing his craft.</p><h2><strong>Education</strong></h2><p>Keem graduated from high school but chose to forgo university to focus on his music career.</p><h2><strong>Career</strong></h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-77150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/baby-keem-name.jpg.webp alt="baby keem name" width=800 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/baby-keem-name.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-2 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-77150 class=wp-caption-text>Baby Keem performs onstage during day three of Rolling Loud Miami – @Getty</p><p>Growing up in a musically inclined family, it seemed like just a matter of time before Keem explored the industry.</p><p>He spent his teenage years sending emails to music bloggers, most of which received no reply.</p><p>In the same interview with Billboard, Keem said he refused to let his unanswered messages discourage him, knowing that he eventually would break through.</p><h2><strong>Debut EP</strong></h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-45488 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/what-is-the-net-worth-of-Baby-Keem.jpg.webp alt="what is the net worth of Baby Keem" width=800 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/what-is-the-net-worth-of-Baby-Keem.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-3 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-45488 class=wp-caption-text>@Getty</p><p>In November of 2017, Keem released his first EP titled Oct under his real name, Hykeem Jamaal Carter Jr.</p><p>The record consisted of nine tracks and featured a range of sounds and styles, from catchy beats to slower ballad-like songs.</p><p>Unfortunately, the EP was eventually removed from streaming services.</p><p>Keem returned two months later with his second EP titled Midnight – a nine-track record that delivered a similar style as its predecessor, only with heightened confidence.</p><p>This EP attracted more listeners, drawing slightly more attention than the first.</p><p>May of 2018 saw Keem making changes.</p><p>He released his third EP called No Name. Unlike his earlier records, No Name had only five tracks, which featured Keem singing rather than rapping.
