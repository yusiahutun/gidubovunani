Pale skin is valued in Asia, where cosmetics to whiten skin are widely advertised. To many Americans, and Asian-Americans, however, the promotion of skin-whitening products appears to be racist and “colourist”.
Whiter is an anthology of essays by Asian-American women on skin colour and “colourism”, edited by Nikki Khanna, a sociologist whose previous work has focused on biracial identity."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

It originated in part from the association of skin colour with class, with darker skin associated with exposure to the sun during manual labour.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The essays are mostly written by academics from East Asia (China, Japan), Southeast Asia (Cambodia, the Philippines), and South Asia (India, Bangladesh). The focus is on how problematic the preference for lighter skin is for Asian-American women as a beauty standard.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Push back against skin whiteners and unhealthy norms they promote</span></p></a></h3>What interests Khanna is how this preference is further refracted in the United States.

We don’t want to be white … [but] I cannot tell you for sure it has nothing to do with white privilege”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The term “white privilege” certainly describes some of the cultural effect of European colonisation, explained by Khanna as “a ‘white is right’ mentality … wherein all things Caucasian and Western (including but not limited to physical appearance) are held up as superior to all things local”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Khanna references scholars alongside bloggers and observations on internet search results, but a more rigorous approach to delineating the origins and manifestations of the Asian preference for lighter skin – as well as the evolution of beauty ideals from Asian to Eurocentric – would be welcome.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/04/20/754e5218-8060-11ea-8736-98edddd9b5ca_972x_144114.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This volume adds to the canon of first-person experiences of prejudice and self-discovery, and may inspire some to pen an equivalent to Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s pro-feminist Dear Ijeawele – a manifesto for embracing one’s appearance and asserting identity.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As journalist, artist and life coach Betty Ming Liu writes in her contribution: “Painting changed me into a colourist. I took a colour theory class, where we mixed the primary pigments of red, blue, and yellow into subtle shades and tints. The results were unpredictable and exciting. I realised that this is how our complexions should be celebrated too.</p>“I can’t stop <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">colourism</span></a>; it’s been here forever.
