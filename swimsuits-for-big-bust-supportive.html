Kuku Nukajam founder of fuller bust swimwear brand Reign Studio, recommends: “Firstly, look for slightly wider than typical straps that are adjustable. Underwire is great for those that want lift, and if you don’t want lift but natural support, look for a style that has adjustable fastening at the back of your bikini top or swimsuit. This helps ensure a firm fit which will aid that natural support.”</p><h2><strong>Where to buy swimwear for big busts</strong></h2><p id=eOeVWOP21mw data-wc=82>Long gone are the days of shoppers having to visit specialist shops for swimwear that caters and supports a larger bust. The high street is no fool, and many shops offer a range of one piece swimsuits for big busts, plus bikinis, with brands like <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopenernofollow nofollow">M&S</a></span> and <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopenernofollow nofollow">John Lewis</a></span> leading the pack with flattering yet practical swimsuits. Online retailers <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopenernofollow nofollow">Bravissimo</a></span> and <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopenernofollow nofollow">Pour Moi</a></span> are also popular, while Triumph, Curvy Kate, Reign and <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopenernofollow nofollow">Boux Avenue</a></span> also cater for those with a fuller chest.</p><p id=esfkh7MR7Ym data-wc=97>I for one have relied on Marks & Spencer in the last few years for swimwear that supports my bust, and rate the <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopenernofollow nofollow">Padded Scallop Swimsuit</a></span> as a supportive swimsuit buy – I wore it on multiple holidays last year and felt fully held in but not restrictive, and it looks stylish too. On my summer holiday, it was cute enough to wear under a gauzy white shirt and denim shorts for lunch, and I saw at least two others wearing it on a Centre Parcs trip last winter, which goes to show it’s doing something right!&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="M&S' designer-inspired 'comfortable' swimsuit is back for 2024 - and in three new colours" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/926db7d9171f-new-marks-and-spencer-swimsuit.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="M&S' designer-inspired 'comfortable' swimsuit is back for 2024 - and in three new colours" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>M&S' designer-inspired 'comfortable' swimsuit is back for 2024 - and in three new colours</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="I love this 5-star Amazon tankini so much I bought it in 6 different colourways" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/b0db7262c9c6-amazon-trending-new-tankini.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="I love this 5-star Amazon tankini so much I bought it in 6 different colourways" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>I love this 5-star Amazon tankini so much I bought it in 6 different colourways</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><h2><strong>How I chose the best swimsuits for big busts</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>Sizing</strong>: I’ve only featured swimsuits that cater for busts over a D cup.

Take advice from HELLO!'s Head of Social, Anna Johnstone, who is somewhat of a self-confessed expert when it comes to shopping for fuller bust swimwear.</p><ul><li><strong>DO</strong> keep away from string halternecks. They look cute, but all they do is hoink up the entire weight of your boobs via a single string on your neck, and after a day, your shoulders and neck are in agony. Stick to a vest or cross-back style. And sadly, thicker straps are your friend.</li><li><strong>DO</strong> take a mix of more stylish and more practical swimwear. I know everyone has the style over substance swimsuits packed in their suitcase, but it's even more important to have options with a larger bust. The swimsuits that look cute with a cocktail are not the same ones you should wear while splashing around in a water park, because most pretty ones are so flimsy, nip slips are inevitable after one jet of water.</li><li><strong>Don't</strong> underestimate the importance of washing your swimwear properly. Swimwear for bigger boobs is all about the shape, and I am so guilty of not washing mine properly after each holiday. If you're investing, make SURE you wash in a delicate cycle after each trip. Chucking them in with my denim shorts has left a few of my swimming costumes ultra flimsy - a big no-no when it comes to holding in boobs!</li></ul><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Best tummy control swimsuits: The most flattering styles we love for 2024" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/74bc719fda26-best-tummy-control-swimsuits-march.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Best tummy control swimsuits: The most flattering styles we love for 2024" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Best tummy control swimsuits: The most flattering styles we love for 2024</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="14 best all-inclusive hotels with top reviews for 2024: Spain, Mexico, Greece & more" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/c1525b469622-all-inclusive-holidays.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="14 best all-inclusive hotels with top reviews for 2024: Spain, Mexico, Greece & more" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>14 best all-inclusive hotels with top reviews for 2024: Spain, Mexico, Greece & more</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="The best luggage brands and suitcases to invest in for your 2024 holiday" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/66ac5cc03b78-suitcase-square.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="The best luggage brands and suitcases to invest in for your 2024 holiday" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>The best luggage brands and suitcases to invest in for your 2024 holiday</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
