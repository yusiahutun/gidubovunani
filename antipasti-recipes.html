Keep reading to learn more about antipasti and ideas for building your ultimate platter!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is antipasti?</h2><p>Antipasti is an Italian appetizer spread consisting of cured meats, cheeses, marinated vegetables and condiments. What makes it from a charcuterie board is that it features a variety of ingredients, while a charcuterie board largely showcases a selection of cured meats. Plus, antipasti is full of savory and sweet flavors — which are sure to start your meal on a tasty note!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Antipasti vs. antipasto</h2><p>It’s worth noting that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">antipasti is plural for antipasto</a>, a Latin-derived word meaning “before the meal.” Despite the difference in spelling, both terms are commonly used interchangeably in recipes and cooking videos referencing this starter.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The ingredients that go into an antipasti spread</h2><p>The old saying “you eat with your eyes first” applies to antipasti as the combination of ingredients makes it taste and look delicious. Below, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Alisa Barry</a>, founder of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bella Cucina</a> at Buckhead Village in Atlanta, shares six types of ingredients you should aim to include in your platter.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. Cheese</h3><p>A variety of cheeses like fresh mozzarella, cheddar, blue cheese and Parmesan provide a mix of hard and soft textures and salty, earthy flavors.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. Meat</h3><p>Add a salty touch to your spread with sliced cured meats such as prosciutto, sopressata, speck and pepperoni.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. Fruit&nbsp;</h3><p>Fresh or dried fruits like quartered figs, apricots, grapes and pitted dates add a sweet touch that complements the salty ingredients.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>4. Condiments&nbsp;</h3><p>Placing condiments like tomato jam, olives, honey or vinaigrette in small bowls allows guests to infuse their serving of antipasti with a sweet or savory kick.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>5. Vegetables&nbsp;</h3><p>Vegetables such as roasted red peppers from a jar, cocktail onions and chopped cucumbers make an antipasti platter extra filling.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>6. Bread</h3><p>Finish with crackers, breadsticks and/or small slices of toasted bread placed next to the other ingredients or in separate bowls.</p><p><strong>See how these kinds of ingredients work to make an antipasti board in this video from the <a href=#>Sobeys YouTube channel</a>.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The best platters to serve antipasti on</h2><p>Having a platter that fits all of the ingredients, whether you’re making antipasti for a few or a crowd, is key. But Barry suggests taking the extra step of serving the ingredients on a nice platter or board to make them more appetizing. “We love an&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">olive wood board</a>&nbsp;or platter for the unique coloring and texture, a marble or&nbsp;slate slab or a white ceramic platter,” she says. “Vintage cutting boards&nbsp;are a great way to add interest and charm.” Ultimately, your guests will be blown away by your DIY antipasti platter that came together in just 20 minutes!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How to make antipasti</h2><p>Making and enjoying antipasti right away allows you to savor the fresh flavors. However, you can make it the night before. Just be sure to wrap the assembled platter tightly in plastic before storing it in the fridge. Then, carefully remove the plastic and serve cold.
