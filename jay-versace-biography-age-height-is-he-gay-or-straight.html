For Jay Versace, the thing that brought him fame is his craziness. He is known for his videos on YouTube and Vine, which capture many things that are strange and entertaining. Here are things you might want to know about him.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Jay Versace Biography and Age</strong></h2><p>He was born on January 24, 1998, in Pleasantville, New Jersey. But the surprising thing is that nobody knows anything about his real name. He grew up with a sister, and just like his name, many other things about him are unknown, including his parents. However, it is known that he was raised by his mother and stepfather.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Who Is Noah Schnapp, How Old Is He, His Net Worth, Height</a></strong></p><p>Although the name is not known, Jay Versace has talked about his school in his videos several times. He talks about how he hated almost everything at school and that he didn’t have the best subject.</p><p>What has brought him into the limelight, as mentioned earlier, are his YouTube channels and his involvement in social media, which has given him a very large fan base. His fame began when he started publishing videos on Vine and then on YouTube. His funny videos, which could take unpredictable turns, soon earned him many followers and subscribers.</p><p>He draws inspiration for his videos from almost everything around him, including his mother and grandmother, who he imitated in most of his videos.</p><p>Where it all began, he now has up to 3 million followers, and on YouTube, he has collected over 700,000 followers since its launch in 2013. His wired videos on YouTube were viewed nearly 20 million times before mid-2018.</p><p>On other social media sites where he also shares his content, Jay Versace has a massive following with over 3 million followers on Instagram and nearly 1.2 million on Twitter.</p><p>It hasn’t been a journey through social media without controversy for him over the years. He was involved in a feud with Princeton Perez of Mindless Behaviour, whose chat he shared in social media because he was tired of the singer and wanted him to leave him alone. It was said that the messages shared between the two were intense, and although Versace warned the other not to send the messages to him anymore, he insisted, and so he shared them.</p><p>Following the messages, which became a big topic of conversation in social media, both Versace and Princeton Perez suspended their Twitter and Instagram accounts before Versace came back to reactivate his own. However, he came out to apologize and explained that he was sharing the chat in anger.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Is he Gay or Straight?</strong></h2><figure id=attachment_20914 class="wp-caption aligncenter amp-wp-inline-086b83d24e4412010a175ea3dba11ca3" aria-describedby=caption-attachment-20914></figure><p>Just as he is different from most stars in most other things, he is different from most others when it comes to his sexual orientation. According to a revelation he has made, he does not prefer either men or women because he would not define himself as heterosexual or gay.</p><p>According to the funny YouTube star, he loves people without necessarily caring about their sex, so he can fall in love with a man or woman. In other words, he is neither gay nor heterosexual, because sexuality is defined as pansexuality.</p><p>In essence, he added, he does not want to be pigeonholed because of his sexuality.</p><p>As for his dating history, Versace has not been associated with anyone in the past, neither with a man nor with a woman. Yet he has not failed to mention on his Twitter that he needs a boyfriend or girlfriend.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Where Is Anna Kooiman Fox News Rising?
