Chances are, the scene is quite different to the routine events in your 20s and 30s that come with flowing champagne and dance floors. A quick Google search will reveal diapers filled with chocolate, instructions on how to play the thrilling ‘measure the bump’ game, and other activities that sound equally awkward.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When it came to planning my own baby shower with a few girlfriends recently, I wanted none of that: nothing overly themed, nothing too self-congratulatory, and nothing too saccharine (generally the opposite of what is the norm in America, where I'm based). After all, you are entertaining adults and expecting them to sacrifice a precious weekend day to celebrate your moment. So, how can you make it an enjoyable affair for everyone? Unlike other milestone events, there’s really no set flow or formula when it comes to baby showers; everything is up for interpretation, which can bring on a minefield of questions around what’s appropriate and what to do for a memorable fête.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Having worked in PR, event planning is second nature, so I wanted to be involved in the organisation. But, as we were looking at ideas, I was surprised at the lack of aspirational guidance out there and at what some people consider to be acceptable. Hosting at a restaurant and expecting guests to pay for a prix fixe menu and bring a gift? Or, hosting at home and tasking friends with making a specific dish? I wouldn’t be surprised if they came down with food poisoning the night before, especially if it’s a colleague or someone that’s really more of an acquaintance. And then there were references that were outright vulgar, like cakes designed to look like a foetus in the womb or games that depict conception.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There are, of course, more elevated examples around, and there are some fabulous options if you’re living in a big city like London or New York, but some of the key components of baby showers can be polarising. If you’re planning on playing host, here are some of the things to consider.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">To theme or not to theme?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">My baby shower was held at Ladurée in New York's Soho, which required very little in the way of décor. Like Ladurée’s other locations around the world, the space looks like a scene from Marie Antoinette with 18th-century Parisian interiors and cascading rainbows of macarons. We had arranged to have it in the winter garden, where plants are assembled in antique urns and white fur-covered chairs surround marble bistro tables. It was freezing that morning, but thankfully, the pastry chef had turned on the heaters before sunrise, so it was balmy enough to check our coats. Everything was kept relatively minimal: the tables were topped with fresh flowers, tiered high tea stands, and personalised menus and place cards written in gold ink by a calligrapher uptown. There was no need for a spending spree on Etsy to embellish the existing space and highlight the obvious reason for the gathering. And that’s something that is beneficial when selecting a venue; opting for a place with an aesthetic that resonates with the expectant mother.</p><img alt="How to host a baby shower" title="How to host a baby shower" width=2400 height=3600 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/baby-shower-2-1562593042.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It all comes down to personal style, and some people prefer to have a central theme on show. Everyone’s seen the clichéd blue for boys, pink for girls, and yellow for a gender neutral setting, but according to data from Google, many people are taking it a step further on the décor front, with the top trending themes currently being Monsters Inc., rubber duckies, and Winnie the Pooh (all up in popularity by over 70% since 2018). Of course, everyone has different tastes, but one would assume that cartoons and such would be reserved for once the baby has actually arrived, perhaps for a first birthday or an occasion better suited to the guests in attendance (assuming it’s a ladies’ affair and not a BYOB scenario).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There’s also a lot of kitsch décor out there that feels contrived and dated. The ubiquitous, vaguely bohemian look involving chalkboards, mason jars, and rustic accents has well and truly had its day. But in a culture where people feel obligated to broadcast everything on social media, excessive theming has become common practice. The late and great Karl Lagerfeld once said “trendy is the last stage before tacky,” and those words are more relevant now than ever. You want to look back and remember the occasion and the special people that were there to celebrate it, rather than see a scene that was staged for Instagram.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">What is acceptable when it comes to gifts and registries?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Registries are definitely worthwhile as guests can see what you actually need and you won’t end up with duplicates. But when you’re putting the list together, think less Bugaboo Fox and SNOO Smart Sleeper and more Bonpoint sock set and Liberty London bibs. One of my girlfriends that hosted my baby shower, and has her own one coming up, created two separate registries: one for friends containing smaller essentials (like Fridababy health kits and Solly Baby wraps), and one with the big-ticket items (including a Bugaboo stroller and a Nuna car seat), for family.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It’s easy to get carried away with all of the gorgeous baby outfits and go to town - just look at the lines from Dolce & Gabbana, Gucci, and Stella McCartney! - but if you’re creating a registry, it’s important to include affordable items also. I listed a range of things that were under £20, like The Pop Pacifiers and Avanchy bowls, all of which any new mother would find useful. The Tot founder, Nasiba Adilova, believes that gifts don’t always need to be practical baby items. “Sometimes the guests closest to you will choose an off-registry gift that is sentimental and meaningful for them,” she tells me. That could involve a piece of jewellery, like an engraved Tiffany & Co. heart tag charm, or perhaps something useful for the expectant mother, like an essential from Isabella Oliver’s chic maternity line, or a voucher for prenatal yoga.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Myka Meier of Beaumont Etiquette (renowned for her course ‘The Duchess Effect’) has a rule for buying something off-registry: “always include a gift receipt.” Another piece of advice? “Ask the mum-to-be if she’d like to open gifts in front of everyone or in private,” she suggests. I opted to open mine in private with my husband, but Meier notes that “either is perfectly fine and it’s a matter of preference.”</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Event format and activities</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">What’s one of the biggest mistakes when it comes to planning the event? According to DockATot founder Lisa Furuland Kotsianis (who is well experienced on both sides of the coin), it’s keeping the organisation limited to friends. “I think one of the biggest baby shower mistakes is not including the mum-to-be in the planning,” she says. “Let her help decide on the activities, décor, food and, of course, the guest list." Meier adds that there is no set etiquette around the format that a baby shower must follow: “It’s what you think the mother-to-be would enjoy most.” That may be a spa session followed by a high tea at Sketch or The Ritz’s stunning Palm Court. Or, perhaps you could book an art class, a course on floral arrangement (as the Duchess of Sussex did for her baby shower), or a cookery class at Leiths, so everyone can master a new type of cuisine and come away with a new skill.</p><img alt="How to throw a baby shower" title="How to throw a baby shower" width=3600 height=2880 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/baby-shower-3-1562593189.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Interactive formats can help with the event flow if you’ve got guests from disparate social circles, too. And, on that note, if it’s a seated event (as mine was), create a seating chart – that way you can ensure that people who know each other are placed together and people that have common interests will have things to talk about. Our table involved an opera singer, medical professionals, corporate power women, Nike trainers, PR girls, several mothers, and artists – a varied mix with many different lines of conversation.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For the activity portion of the event, cards replicating the invitation design were printed featuring a Q+A section on the back where guests could guess the name and offer words of wisdom. These asked: What should the baby do in her first year? What should she do before she’s 21? And, my personal favourite, the best things in life are_____. The hosts read them out after we had finished brunch and we put them in a special book for our daughter to look back on in the future.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Finally, Myka Meier has some views on what not to say at a baby shower:</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">· Horror stories about birth: "My friend's cousin went into labour a month early in a taxi!"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">· Unsolicited advice: While people may love to share experiences, be sure the mum-to-be is open to hearing them.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">· Showing judgement about her decisions: "You plan to/not plan to have an epidural? Are you sure that's the best choice?"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">· Asking too personal a question, such as "So will you breast feed?" If the mum-to-be brings it up or volunteers the topic, then it's fine to chat away; each woman has her own plan, so let her share it if she wishes.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">· Jokes or comments about her size: "Wow, do you have twins in there?" Just don't go there.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwr9Slq66qlWS5qrLErKuypJWUtbC5xKxmmmpoZ4NzgpVsZqGnp2LBsHnHqKqtZZFisKm1wmaZmpqpYsCpu9aeqWg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./appetizers.html><span>←</span><span>Appetizers smitten kitchen</span></a>
