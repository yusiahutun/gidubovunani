But that doesn’t mean that you owe the things you truly believe to someone else for your entire life.”</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Daniel Radcliffe joins David Holmes in The Boy Who Lived documentary</figure><p id=e6S6lLgzsRa data-wc=54>The dad-of-one also spoke about his sadness at the situation, explaining: “It makes me really sad, ultimately, because I do look at the person that I met, the times that we met, and the books that she wrote, and the world that she created, and all of that is to me so deeply empathic.”</p><p id=egKG85IgOoN data-wc=88>Joanne has been divisive with her views on the trans community, and Harry Potter stars Daniel and Emma Watson have spoken against her viewpoint. At the time, Emma released a statement that read: “Trans people are who they say they are and deserve to live their lives without being constantly questioned or told they aren’t who they say they are. I want my trans followers to know that I and so many other people around the world see you, respect you and love you for who you are.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3c7360b041a1-gettyimages-1193619782.jpg><p id=epA7stMl1Ge data-wc=45>Daniel’s statement read: “Transgender women are women. Any statement to the contrary erases the identity and dignity of transgender people and goes against all advice given by professional health care associations who have far more expertise on this subject matter than either Jo or I.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/793c77af646f-gettyimages-1388427445.jpg><p id=ePMuRE98HaI data-wc=79>Speaking to one of her followers about whether the actors would be “safe in the knowledge” that she would accept an apology from them if they ever chose to do so in the future, she replied: "Not safe, I’m afraid. Celebs who cosied up to a movement intent on eroding women’s hard-won rights and who used their platforms to cheer on the transitioning of minors can save their apologies for traumatised detransitioners and vulnerable women reliant on single-sex spaces.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ee3283e58471-daniel-radcliffe.jpg><p id=eIeHttmhuUNH data-wc=65>Evanna Lynch, who played Luna Lovegood in the Harry Potter series, also shared her views on the subject, telling the Telegraph: "I just felt that her character has always been to advocate for the most vulnerable members of society. The problem is that there’s a disagreement over who’s the most vulnerable. I do wish people would just give her more grace and listen to her.”&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Inside JK.
