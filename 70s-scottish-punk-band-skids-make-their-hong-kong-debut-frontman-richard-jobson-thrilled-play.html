It was all about the music – and the fashion: in high school he dyed his hair black and white and wore “really tight trousers”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“When I was about 15, a friend and I borrowed a motorcycle – we didn’t have a licence – and rode it all the way from Scotland to London in a brutal winter to buy leather trousers,” he says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/22/ad2f382b-b730-4983-b00e-6a74547cdca9_5161aa04.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While in the British capital, they squeezed in a gig by Sid Vicious – best known as the bassist for punk outfit the Sex Pistols – who was playing with fellow rockers Siouxsie and the Banshees.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We met Vicious and he was amazed that these little kids had come all the way on a bike and then rode back in the early morning […] We were proper little punks,” says Jobson, who not long after would become a founding member of his own punk band.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I was about 16, just a kid, when I joined the Skids – my life changed overnight. When you’re that age, you’re not really equipped to deal with such a dramatic event in your life,” says Jobson, whose credits also include television presenter and author, including his autobiography, Into The Valley (2018).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He has also carved out a name in film, writing and directing the 2004 drama 16 Years of Alcohol, based on the death of his brother, and The Purifiers (2004), a martial arts movie set in a futuristic Scotland that pays homage to Lee.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A film, tentatively called Bloodline and set in Hong Kong, is also on his radar. A few years ago he was in the city discussing it with Hong Kong director Wong Kar-wai and actor Andy Lau Tak-wah.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While his creative juices are flowing faster than ever, Jobson says his punk attitude has mellowed. “I’m older, wiser and understand what it all means, and my ego and narcissism have been tempered.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The drive to connect with his audience is also stronger than ever.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“You’re out there on stage having a blast, transmitting a very positive thing to an audience,” he says. “The essential thing for me is to have as much fun as I can muster in that hour and a half.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Skids 45th Anniversary Tour, April 30, The Wanch, 1/F, Henan Building, 90 Jaffe Road, Wan Chai. 8pm.
