Starting up a new business involves budget allocation, location hunt, structural development, research and more research. To succeed in any business, you need to know how it works and the marketing strategies you can apply to stand out from your competitors.</p><h2>List of the best businesses to start with 200k in Kenya</h2><p class=align-left>Which is the most profitable business to start with 200k? There are so many businesses you can start in <a href=# rel=noopener>Kenya</a> with a budget of 200k, but here are the most lucrative:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8365390ff63d1457.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Worst businesses to start in Kenya: The top 10 list</span></p></a><h3>1. Cyber café</h3><p class=align-left>A cyber café is the best business to start in Kenya with 200k. With a budget of 200k, you can get a photocopying machine, a printing machine, and two computers for browsing. You'll also need a good internet connection and a secure business room where you can lock in your machines.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8365390ff63d1457.jpg><p class=align-left>For this kind of business, you need to have basic knowledge of how to operate these machines. Opening a cyber café in a strategic location such as near a tertiary learning institution is an added advantage. On a good day, you can go home with over Ksh. 4000 profit.</p><p class=align-left>With time, you'll save up and expand the number of services you provide. You can buy more machines such as a laminating machine, a colour photocopy machine, and many others to offer more services.</p><h3>2. Laundry service business</h3><p class=align-left>With the current busy schedules, providing excellent cleaning services to clients can save them a lot of time and energy. This business requires just a few supplies. You'll need a high-quality washing machine, hangers, plastic bags and washing detergents to begin with. This business requires your clients to drop their dirty laundry in your shop.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/316204fcf4801985.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The top 10 characteristics of a good business opportunity</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Setting up a dry cleaning service centre is a great business idea as it generates a lot of profit. You can choose to provide unique services, such as offering your customers a subscription service. Get signage that lists all the services provided in your shop and put it on top of your store so that you can attract a huge number of people.</p><p class=align-left>Choosing the location of your business matters a lot as this business is best suited in a high foot traffic area. Do not forget to get a cash register for your business.</p><h3>3. Selling clothes</h3><p class=align-left>Selling clothes is also among the low-risk, high-profit business ideas. To successfully begin a clothing business, you'll need to develop your clothing brand. The best location for a boutique is preferably in a high traffic area with fewer boutiques.</p><p class=align-left>When choosing clothes for your boutique, go for unique designs instead of the common pieces that most people wear. You should always have enough clothes of all sizes in your store, especially for kids and ladies because they're usually in high demand, especially during the festive seasons.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/20391115a655f22a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to become a business-oriented person</span></p></a><h3>4. Farming</h3><p class=align-left>Farming is another excellent business idea. You can choose to keep animals or start farming. Most agribusinesses can be started without formal training. You can plant fruit trees, and when they mature, you'll harvest profits for countless years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d4297725aedccfe9.jpg><p class=align-left>Fish farming is also another branch of farming that you should venture into. The reduction in fish in the large water bodies has made the demand for fish from ponds to go high. So if you are in an ideal location where you can rear fish, why not try it out!</p><p class=align-left>You can also get a greenhouse where you can plant groceries used in almost every household. The demand for groceries is always high. As time goes by, you will be able to grow your business.</p><h3>5. Cake baking business</h3><p class=align-left>Opening up a cake baking business is an excellent idea as most Kenyans love food. Cakes are also used to mark almost every occasion these days. Learning how to decorate your cakes in the best manner possible is an added advantage as people want their cakes decorated in a manner that appeals to the eye.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f2b9a6d8f39142ce.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to start a water bottling company in Kenya</span></p></a><p class=align-left>To start this business, you only need to get an oven, baking tins, weighing scales and a few kitchen utensils for cleaning up and mixing the dough. On a good day, one can make profits of up to Ksh. 6000. As time goes by, you'll advance and get other labour saving equipment and employ more people to help you in the business.</p><h3>6. Grocery store</h3><p class=align-left>A grocery store business is a low-risk, high-profit business idea as groceries and cereals are consumed in most households in Kenya. You can open up a huge grocery store in a clean and spacious room with your shelves clearly labelled and aligned. This will make your store have a classier taste, and you'll be able to attract a lot of people.</p><p class=align-left>You only need to recognize the areas where you can shop for fresh vegetables and groceries at a cheaper price. Always plan ahead and ensure that you don't run out of supplies. You can also do small promotions to attract more people to your store. On a good day, a grocery store can give you profits of over Ksh. 6000 per day.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/3f64df660b27019b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to start a tour company successfully in Kenya</span></p></a><h3>7. Mobile money transfer</h3><p class=align-left>Money transfer business is among the most profitable businesses ideas in Kenya. The more transactions you a day, the higher your profits. Identify the location with high traffic. The best set up for this business is in areas such as close to higher learning institutions, bus stops, human settlement areas and any other place that's densely populated.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/316204fcf4801985.jpg><p class=align-left>M-Pesa is the most common money transfer business. Opening an M-Pesa agent shop together with other local bank agencies, will fetch you high profits. What's even more convenient with this business is that it doesn't require a lot of room as you can operate in a booth, making it one of the most profitable business to start with 200k.</p><h3>8. Wines and spirits</h3><p class=align-left>There's often a common saying that says, Kenya is a drinking nation, so why not try out a wines and spirits store? The wines and spirits business is one of the most all-time profitable businesses due to the consistent demand. You only need to keep your stock balanced so that you don't run out of stock.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/3dfcc92ab4f21cdb.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Amazing guide on how to become a Glover</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Staying informed on your industry's market trends will help you know the marketing strategy of your business. The trickiest part of this business is its licensing and legal requirements. Sometimes the authorities dictate that you open at a given time. Failure to adhere to such regulations could land you in trouble.</p><h3>9. Cosmetic shop</h3><p class=align-left>You can take your beauty talent to another level by opening a cosmetics shop. Cosmetics is the most profitable business in Kenya. You need to get enough tips on how to set your business apart from your competitors. The location of your business will also determine the success of your business.</p><p class=align-left>Research what is not commonly offered by your competitors and avail it at a reasonable price. Getting fast-moving products such as makeup, perfumes, skincare products, hair brands for ladies, and beard and moustache care products for men will help you <a href=#>draw</a> the attention of most people. Getting cheap suppliers will help you minimize operational costs.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/fae5a25a6e63eb29.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 5 factors to consider when choosing a betting site in Kenya</span></p></a><h3>10.

Dreadlocks, on the other hand, cost between Ksh. 500 to Ksh. 3000 depending on the location too.</p><p class=align-left>Combining both services is an added advantage as dreadlocks do not consume a lot of time, depending on your speed.
