She made efforts to hide her love life under her nose for her admirers. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-180 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>But despite her secrecy, her followers&nbsp;gained few insights into her love life. It had&nbsp;come to light that she was&nbsp;married and shared&nbsp;a strong bond of support with her husband, Dan Greiner.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Dated Jim Carrey:-</strong><a href=# rel=follow>&nbsp;Renee Zellweger Husband, Married, Family, Net Worth</a></p><p style=text-align:justify>Lori has been sharing the marital&nbsp;bond with her partner-in-crime for more than a decade. Lori and Dan first crossed paths in 1996 at a&nbsp;bar in Chicago&nbsp;called Kincaid's.</p><p style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-181 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span data-ez-ph-id=181 style="margin-top:15px!important;display:block!important;line-height:0;border:0 solid #ddd!important;margin-bottom:15px!important;text-align:center!important;max-width:970px;padding:0;background:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;background-color:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;float:none!important;margin-right:auto!important;margin-left:auto!important;min-width:970px;min-height:400px;width:970px"></span>The pair had an immediate connection, and since then they have been going strong with their relationship.</p><p style=text-align:justify>However, there aren't many details that have surfaced in the media&nbsp;regarding their love life. Their wedding details are still a mystery to their followers. And it is still not known when and where the pair exchanged their wedding vows.</p><p style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span data-ez-ph-id=183 style="line-height:0;background:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;margin-top:15px!important;margin-right:auto!important;margin-left:auto!important;display:block!important;padding:0;border:0 solid #ddd!important;float:none!important;margin-bottom:15px!important;text-align:center!important;max-width:970px;background-color:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;width:970px;min-width:970px;min-height:400px"></span></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Lori Greiner with husband Dan Greiner&nbsp;</strong>(Photo: marriedbiography.com)</p><p style=text-align:justify>Lori, so-called “Queen of QVC,” and her other half Dan currently own&nbsp;two homes combinedly. Lori and Dan both are the owners of their Philly home near their QVC studio and another home in Chicago where her products are shipped.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Well, despite being married for a long time the couple does not yet have children. Moreover, they haven't even revealed any plan on having kids either. It seems like Lori and her husband are much focused on her career than building a family life right now.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Supportive Partner-In-Crime</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Lori Greiner, who is an investor on&nbsp;Shark Tank, has&nbsp;had her career on rising since she invented her plastic jewelry organizer for earrings. Turns out, since the beginning&nbsp;of her business, Lori had her husband's support&nbsp;on her shoulder as he managed&nbsp;the finance for her.</p><p style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-185 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span data-ez-ph-id=185 style="display:block!important;max-width:970px;padding:0;border:0 solid #ddd!important;margin-top:15px!important;margin-right:auto!important;background-color:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;line-height:0;width:970px;margin-left:auto!important;text-align:center!important;min-height:400px;background:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;float:none!important;margin-bottom:15px!important;min-width:970px"></span>Before joining in business with his wife, Lori, Dan was an assistant controller at the former&nbsp;Bell & Howell Co.&nbsp;After six years into their relationship, Dan quit his job as the assistant controller and assisted Lori in her company&nbsp;For Your Ease Only. Talking about her husband's supportive nature towards her, she shared through her book Invent it, Sell it, Bank it!: Make your Million-Dollar Idea into a Reality&nbsp;quoting,</p><p style=text-align:justify>“He’s cautious – not at all the type to push the envelope, And yet, in this instance, he was on board from the minute I told him about my idea.”</p><p style=text-align:justify>Currently, Dan serves as the Chief Financial Officer and Vice President of the company and together they reside&nbsp;in the town of&nbsp;Chicago.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Age, Net Worth & Recent Years</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Lori who was born on&nbsp;9 December&nbsp;1969, sure has been able to make a name for her herself with support from her husband. Among one of her invents through Shark Tank, Lori along with&nbsp;Robert Herjavec invested $150k in Mensch On A Bench&nbsp;which&nbsp;would help reinforce Jewish traditions and values. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-631 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span data-ez-ph-id=631 style="text-align:center!important;padding:0;float:none!important;background:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;width:970px;margin-bottom:15px!important;margin-left:auto!important;display:block!important;min-width:250px;min-height:400px;max-width:970px;background-color:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;border:0 solid #ddd!important;margin-top:15px!important;margin-right:auto!important;line-height:0"></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>But her tenure in Shark Tank hasn't been all easy going as the TV icon isn't afraid to speak up against any wrongdoing off-screen.
