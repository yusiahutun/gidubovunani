Well, to start, women are constantly bombarded with the message that their “ideal” weight is only a little extra willpower away. If you believe that, investing in a forever piece at a sustainable, made-in-America price point (Hackwith’s dresses can get into the $300 range) can seem like a waste of money.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I think that mindset is shifting,” Husted says. She points to women like comedian and author Lindy West and writer Roxane Gay, who’ve both (in their words) “come out” as fat. As in, this is the size I am and I’m not trying to change it. Still, according to a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://sourcingjournal.com/topics/consumer-insights/plus-size-shoppers-coresight-research-retail-spending-159715/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="2019 survey" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>2019 survey</u></a>, women who fall in the plus-size category still tend to spend just 83 cents on the dollar compared to straight-size shoppers, and statistically have a lower income.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Luckily, secondhand fashion has become a sexy entry point for discerning consumers on a budget. Hackwith has <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://hackwithdesignhouse.com/product-category/sustain-shop/sustain-plus/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sustain Plus" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Sustain Plus</u></a>, and Eileen Fisher has <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.eileenfisherrenew.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Eileen Fisher Renew" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Eileen Fisher Renew</u></a>, both stocked with secondhand versions of their high-end products that have been cleaned, mended, and upcycled for double the sustainability at half the price.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Make no mistake, there are plenty of women above a size 12 who have some money to spend and aren’t afraid of color. For them, there’s <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://roopapemmaraju.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Roopa class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Roopa</u></a> by Roopa Pemmaraju, who is so committed to sustainability that she’ll take back her designs from clients if they get stained or ripped for overdyeing and repair. On her website, sizes range from XXS to XXL, and customers who fall outside of that framework are encouraged to email with their measurements. “I don’t call it plus sizing. I just call it custom sizing,” Pemmaraju says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Roopa works exclusively with natural fabrics of silk, recycled cotton, and linen—she can’t and won’t add synthetic material to her creations to give them stretch, a common crutch for mass-market brands offering extended sizing. “Rayon and spandex and polyester, I don’t even like to hear those words, because it’s not something I believe in,” she says. “The future doesn’t lie in those fabrics. Silk helps your body flow. Whatever type and size you are, it gives you a good shape.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Not only does it add to her ethical cred that all her colorful dresses, fluttering tops, and hand-embellished jackets are made under one roof at her zero-waste studio in Bangalore, India, it’s crucial for size inclusivity. “It can only be done when you have this system in place, all under one roof,” she says. “My master patternmaker has been with me since the time we started. Some of my customers come back each season, we have their specs ready in the studio. If you’re manufacturing elsewhere, it’s going to be a tedious process, because you have to stick to the sizing and put in a certain number of orders for that sizing.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She has good company in Hackwith (made in their St. Paul, Minnesota, studio), Elizabeth Suzann (made in her Nashville studio), and Day/Won, which is made to order in Upstate New York by a woman-owned factory—Huffine not only wanted to support jobs in the United States, she needed to keep a close eye on the process as she developed the sizing.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“It’s a lot of work,” Huffine says. “If we want to bring in new silhouettes and fabrics, we do a whole new fit to make sure it’s working for all sizes.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Extending sizing” is actually a bit of a misnomer. It actually entails developing an entirely new collection. Straight sizes are usually based on a size 4, with inches being added or subtracted from there. “Pieces for extended sizing need separate fittings, patterns, and design changes,” Hoffman says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Only in the past year, our margins have loosened up to be close to the straight-size margins,” Husted says. It took Hackwith a couple years to find the right fit for models who were a size 2X, and there’s the additional cost of using more sustainable fabric in each piece, especially since inclusive designers don’t want to charge their plus-size clients more.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Internet can sometimes <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.thecut.com/2018/11/what-to-know-about-jesse-kamm-and-madewell-drama.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="be unkind" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>be unkind</u></a> to small brands and designers who they see as deliberately excluding plus-size ladies, but an email asking for what you want can go a long way—just give them some time to develop it for you. It is slow fashion, after all.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“The majority of the feedback we have received is celebratory and grateful,” Hoffman says. “We have also heard that people want more selection, and they want it to happen faster than we can deliver. Being an independently run company, more and faster is challenging for us. But this is our goal, and we’re making it happen at a pace that we can financially and with the resources that we have.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Everything about a small sustainable brand is overwhelming,” says Huffine. “It’s hard, but at the end of the day, what you’re providing the women of the world, it’s worth it to do. It seems like a lot at first, and then you get in your groove and it sorts itself out.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">So if you’re reading this, and you’re a designer or brand manager, don’t be scared. The market is ready for you. “We get really excited when we see other independent brands venturing into extended sizing,” Husted says. “The more independent brands like ours offering extended sizing, the more we’re all going to see growth.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“And the more bigger brands see, oh, we have no excuse!”<br></p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/82c571f9-9236-48fb-a2b6-f3de900f89fa_1481064168.jpeg alt="Headshot of Alden Wicker" title="Headshot of Alden Wicker" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Alden Wicker is a writer and sustainable fashion expert.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfm660tMiopWiclai2qLrEq6pomWNnf3J%2FlXBtaKicqsBuv8iznGarpajBorXNmpmlnV2brrS0yKilaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./karena-and-katrina-tone-it-up.html><span>←</span><span>10 Tips To Lose Weight from 'Tone It Up' Founders Karena and Katrina</span></a>
