Most people search for ChatGPT on the Mac App Store and install one of the initial results. But, as recent reports suggest, it's a habit you must stay away from.</p><h2 id=shady-chatgpt-apps-are-flooding-the-app-store>Shady ChatGPT Apps Are Flooding the App Store</h2><p>Apple recommends the Mac App Store as one of the safest ways to download and install apps. It is true most of the time as well. However, following the dramatic popularity of ChatGPT, developers are flooding the Mac App Store with shady and buggy ChatGPT apps. Many of these apps also have elements that are frequently used to scam users.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chatgpt-results-on-mac-app-store.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This problematic side of the Mac App Store was unearthed in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alex Kleber's Medium post</a>. The author discovered that the popular results for terms like ChatGPT and OpenAI are fraudulent apps that do not deliver what they promise.</p><p>For instance, many apps are either blocked by a paywall or do not work whatsoever. While some apps work for the first few minutes, you are presented with an in-app purchase pop-up on the screen.</p><p>Further research on the issue also indicated that most of these problematic "ChatGPT" apps come from similar or the same developers. Therefore, the author believes these apps are part of a scam network that wants to capitalize on the increasing demand for GPT-style services.</p><p>To create a sense of legitimacy, these apps reuse the logo and design elements of OpenAI and ChatGPT. It happens even though OpenAI does not have a native ChatGPT app for macOS</p><p>While only Apple can do something about mitigating this issue of problematic apps, you must stay far away from these ChatGPT apps on the Mac App Store.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-to-safely-use-chatgpt-on-a-mac>How to Safely Use ChatGPT on a Mac</h2><p>Despite the abundance of shady ChatGPT apps, there are two ways to access ChatGPT from your Mac safely.</p><h3 id=use-the-web-interface>1. Use the Web Interface</h3><p>The web interface of OpenAI is the safest way to use ChatGPT on your Mac. Considering that OpenAI has not yet developed a native app for macOS, Windows, iOS, or Android, the web interface seems to be the best option for most people.</p><p>And while <a href=#>ChatGPT has problems</a>, the web app works fine almost always. You can access the web interface of OpenAI's ChatGPT by visiting <a href=#>chat.openai.com</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chatgpt-web-interface-on-mac.jpg><p>You need to register for an account if you don't already have one. OpenAI also lets you <a href=#>choose between the free and paid versions of ChatGPT</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=use-macgpt>2. Use MacGPT</h3><p>If you want a more native experience with ChatGPT on your Mac, you should check out MacGPT. It's one of the few legitimate apps that help you integrate ChatGPT into your Mac. For instance, you can make MacGPT work as a macOS menu bar app.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/macgpt-running-on-mac.jpg><p>This menu bar interface will help you interact with ChatGPT without needing to open a separate browser window. The same app enables you to seek the help of ChatGPT with various text fields and even the Spotlight Search interface. With just a trigger word, you can let ChatGPT do all the typing.</p><p>We should mention that the setup requires more than signing into your OpenAI account. To set up the MacGPT app on your Mac, you need to create a ChatGPT API key from the OpenAI website and paste it into the app's home screen. Our <a href=#>complete guide to ChatGPT APIs</a> will help you do it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You can download MacGPT from its official website. However, you'll likely need ChatGPT Plus to get the best experience from the app.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MacGPT</a> (Free)</p><h2 id=use-chatgpt-on-your-mac-the-right-way>Use ChatGPT on Your Mac the Right Way</h2><p>There is no doubt that ChatGPT can help you increase productivity and simplify your workflow. And that's exactly why you may want a convenient way to access it on your Mac. But it's important you understand the different aspects of the AI service, including the privacy implications, before jumping in.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGiuobFdlsOwtcNmmqGZpJy9tXnAqaesZZ%2Bjeq6twmaYqahdqMGwvsRo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./meghan-markle-victoria-beckham-slogan-tees.html><span>←</span><span>Meghan Markle and Victoria Beckham are making slogan tees 2024's coolest t-shirt trend</span></a>
