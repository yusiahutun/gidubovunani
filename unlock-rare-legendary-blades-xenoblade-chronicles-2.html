Rare Blades are unique and have more abilities than generic Blades, but they are more difficult to find during any playthrough. They either require luck when using Core Crystals or are obtained in other circumstances.</p><p data-injection=true>Finding them all is no small task, but it will be worth the effort. If you aren’t sure how to obtain any of the Rare Blades, this list will cover their locations and how to unlock them while playing Xenoblade Chronicles 2.</p><h2>All Rare Blades Obtained In The Story</h2><p>It is important to note that this list does contain story spoilers for important plot points throughout Xenoblade Chronicles 2. Make sure you’re ready to encounter those while reading through this list.</p><h3>1. Pyra</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/04202338/Xenoblade-Chronicles-2-Pyra-850x478.jpg><p>Pyra will be the first Rare Blade that you obtain, and she will naturally enter your party in <strong>Chapter 1</strong> o Xenoblade Chronicles 2.

Dromarch</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/04202646/Xenoblade-Chronicles-2-Dromarch-850x478.jpg><p>Dromarch will join your party along with Nia as his Driver during the events of <strong>Chapter 2 in Xenoblade Chronicles 2</strong>.

After helping Tora build Poppi, she will join your team as its second Blade until rescuing Nia and Dromarch.</p><h3>4. Mythra</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/13221713/Xenoblade-Chronicles-2-Mythra-850x478.jpg><p>Mythra will be obtained during the events of <strong>Chapter 3 of Xenoblade Chronicles 2</strong>. Unlike other Blades, she doesn’t enter your party per se but will be able to switch places with Pyra in combat, giving Rex access to two Blades in one slot.</p><h3>5. Roc</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/04204917/Xenoblade-Chronicles-2-Roc-850x478.jpg><p>After the events of Chapter 3, you will obtain Roc’s Core Crystal. It isn’t until Chapter 4 that you will be able to use it, as you will need Roc’s help to overcome an obstacle in Xenoblade Chronicles 2.</p><h3>6. Poppi QT</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/04202926/Xenoblade-Chronicles-2-Poppi-QT-850x478.jpg><p>Poppi QT will be introduced during the<strong> latter half of Chapter 4</strong>, after investigating the outbreak of artificial Blades that are coming out of Mor Ardain. It is a new form of Poppi and will be added to Tora’s Blade line-up after you learn how to use it in Xenoblade Chronicles 2.</p><h3>7. Brighid</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/04210312/Xenoblade-Chronicles-2-Brighid-850x478.jpg><p>While you meet Brighid in Chapter 2, she will not formally join your party until <strong>Chapter 5 of Xenoblade Chronicles 2</strong>. Her Driver Mòrag will join your party, and Brighid will also come along.</p><h3>8. Pandoria</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/04211113/Xenoblade-Chronicles-2-Pandoria-850x478.jpg><p>Just like Brighid, you will meet Pandoria as early as Chapter 3. You won’t learn much about her until <strong>Chapter 5 in Xenoblade Chronicles 2</strong>, where she and her Driver Zeke will formally join your party.</p><h3>9. Aegaeon</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/04211758/Xenoblade-Chronicles-2-Aegaeon-850x478.jpg><p>Aegaeon will be obtained during the <strong>events of Chapter 6</strong>, though unlike other Rare Blades obtained in the story, he will come in his Core Crystal and must be activated in order to join your party in Xenoblade Chronicles 2.</p><h2>10. Nia</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/04213542/Xenoblade-Chronicles-2-Nia-Blade-850x478.jpg><p>Nia will be obtained during the events of <strong>Chapter 7</strong>, where she will reveal herself to be a Blade during Xenoblade Chronicles 2. While Nia will remain a Blade, she can switch between being a Blade and a Driver, but not during combat.</p><h2>11. Pneuma</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/04214242/Xenoblade-Chronicles-2-Pneuma-850x478.jpg><p>Pneuma will also be introduced in <strong>Chapter 7 of Xenoblade Chronicles 2</strong>. Her overwhelming power will be on display in Chapter 7, but after that, she will only be accessible once per battle for a short time.</p><h2>All Optional Rare Blades Obtained From Core Crystals</h2><p data-injection=true>For the Blades obtained through Core Crystals, any Core Crystal will do — Common, Rare, or Legendary. However, Legendary Core Crystals have the best chance of producing Rare Blades, while Common Core Crystals have the worst (Rare Core Crystals are in the middle) in Xenoblade Chronicles 2.</p><p>Some Blades are placed into groups based on your save file (a value invisible to you) that makes their appearance more likely/less likely, with five groups in total. Some Blades will be classified as “pity” Rare Blades. If you continually fail to get Rare Blades from your Core Crystals, the chance of a “pity” Blade showing up increases until it is essentially guaranteed.</p><h3>12. Godfrey</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/04221420/Xenoblade-Chronicles-2-Godfrey-850x478.jpg><p>Godfrey is a Rare Blade that you can obtain by using <strong>Core Crystals</strong>. His appearance rates are decent, and he is likely to appear after using enough Core Crystals. If your save file happens to be in Groups 1 or 2 of Xenoblade Chronicles 2, he is one of the “pity” Blades who becomes more likely to appear after summoning a regular Blade.</p><h2>13. Agate</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/04221739/Xenoblade-Chronicles-2-Agate-850x478.jpg><p>Agate is a Rare Blade that you can obtain by using <strong>Core Crystals</strong> in Xenoblade Chronicles 2. Her appearance rates aren’t as high as Godfrey’s, but she belongs to the same save file group (Groups 1 or 2). She is one of the “pity” Blades who becomes more likely to appear after summoning a regular Blade.</p><h3>14. Boreas</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/04222712/Xenoblade-Chronicles-2-Boreas-850x478.jpg><p>Boreas is a Rare Blade that you can obtain by using Core Crystals. Despite being a “pity” Blade for Groups 1 and 2, his appearance rates are better for <strong>Groups 2 and 3 in Xenoblade Chronicles 2</strong>.</p><h2>15.

He is a “pity” Blade for Group 3, with solid appearance rates across all groups in Xenoblade Chronicles 2.</p><h3>16. Azami</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/04232321/Xenoblade-Chronicles-2-Azami-850x478.jpg><p>Azami is a Rare Blade that you can obtain from using Core Crystals. She is a “pity” Blade for Group 3, but has good appearance rates except for Groups 1 and 5 in Xenoblade Chronicles 2.</p><h3>17. Adenine</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/04232831/Xenoblade-Chronicles-2-Adenine-850x478.jpg><p>Adenine is a Rare Blade that you can obtain by using Core Crystals.

Wulfric</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/05004219/Xenoblade-Chronicles-2-Wulfric-850x478.jpg><p data-injection=true>Wulfric is met in Chapter 3 as part of the Elder Arachno boss fight when working with Vandham for Xenoblade Chronicles 2.

This will trigger the appearance of the Gluttonous Marrin, who will now randomly appear whenever Rex uses the Salvage Point at Chansagh Wastes in Mor Ardain.</p><p>This may take a few tries, but you will battle the Gluttonous Marrin after one salvage trip. It will drop the Lucky Core Crystal upon its defeat, giving you Kasandra upon activation in Xenoblade Chronicles 2.</p><h3>35.
