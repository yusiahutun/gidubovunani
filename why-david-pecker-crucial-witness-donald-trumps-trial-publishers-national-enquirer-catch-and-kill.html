But the Enquirer protected other powerful men too – including Harvey Weinstein and Arnold Schwarzenegger – and threatened to expose Jeff Bezos’ extramarital affair with his now-fiancée Lauren Sánchez.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Read on to find out what went down.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">How did David Pecker and Donald Trump meet?</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/05/02/8ec3f4a7-449c-4246-ba98-d4659a37de29_f4c40053.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Pecker and Trump met in the late 1980s at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort, per Fox 59. Testifying in court, Pecker described a “great, mutually beneficial relationship” with the former president, saying, “[Trump] helped me throughout my career.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">‘Master hater’?

In court on April 26, prosecutor Joshua Steinglass described a story about Trump’s alleged 2006-07 affair with Playboy model Karen McDougal as “National Enquirer gold” – that is, if Pecker had chosen to run with it in 2016.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Per The New Yorker, in August 2016, AMI paid McDougal US$150,000 to buy the rights to her story about her alleged nine-month affair with Trump – and then never published an article about it. Per the same publication, AMI was said to have paid a Trump Tower doorman US$30,000 in late 2015 for a story about a possible Trump “love child”, which turned out to be false.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Protecting Harvey Weinstein</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/05/02/1fb59348-bd7e-4c7d-9d68-097109e73804_a571666c.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Following The New York Times’ October 2017 investigative report detailing numerous allegations of sexual misconduct against Harvey Weinstein – which triggered the #MeToo movement – it was revealed that AMI had played a role in protecting the disgraced movie mogul.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In January 2015, Variety reported that the Weinstein Co. had struck a deal with AMI to produce a live daily talk show.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Malia Obama’s film career so far – from internships to her directorial debut</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">What the public did not know at the time was that Weinstein and his team were desperately scrambling to protect the Hollywood producer’s image, as it became increasingly impossible to hide information about his many alleged crimes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/05/02/cffe5005-99a6-4b80-bcbf-a55d25b05ba3_d7491f3d.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In December 2017, The New York Times published a follow-up article about how AMI was known to use catch and kill to “help out allies in trouble”.</p><a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Journalist Ronan Farrow</span></a> – who in 2017 said NBC News declined to publish his own investigation into Weinstein, with his article finding a home in The New Yorker in October of that year – told CNN last month that he and other journalists first heard the term “catch and kill” from AMI employees.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Arnold Schwarzenegger’s gubernatorial run</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/05/02/df1093a6-7550-48db-8385-41b3659b30f8_ae37834e.jpg>Pecker testified that he was initially reluctant to pay off McDougal after an unsatisfactory experience of trying to catch and kill stories on behalf of <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Arnold Schwarzenegger</span></a>, per AP News.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After Arnie announced his run for California governor in 2003, 30 to 40 women contacted the Enquirer, alleging either extramarital affairs or sexual harassment by the movie star, testified Pecker, as reported in the LA Times.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">What do we know about Maria Shriver, presidential hopeful RFK Jr’s cousin?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Pecker told the court he spent hundreds of thousands of US dollars on the rights to such stories – only for the LA Times to publish, in the lead-up to the election, accusations by more than a dozen women that Schwarzenegger had groped them.
