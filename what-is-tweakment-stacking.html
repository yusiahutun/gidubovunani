In men, this starts around the age of 50, but in women, these changes can begin much earlier, from 40 onwards.&nbsp;</p><p id=e348FnCf3f_z data-wc=47>“This loss of volume contributes to sagging facial skin, decreased skin projection and a loss of jawline definition. As the jawbone recedes, the soft tissue of the lower face no longer has a robust framework, resulting in a rounder and less defined appearance to the lower face.&nbsp;</p><p id=eh8csfkvvn data-wc=9><strong>WATCH three aesthetic doctors discuss tweakment trends for 2023:&nbsp;</strong></p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><p id=ebTHwbFqTaR8 data-wc=29>“Tired eyes are also a major concern for patients. The anatomy of the eye is very complex and there’s not a single cause behind making the eyes appear tired.&nbsp;</p><p id=eHrcntefCA6k data-wc=49>“With all elements of ageing, the changes seen on the face are not caused solely by one element and, so of course, there’s not a single treatment that can completely resolve this concern, which is where 'treatment stacking' comes into play and why my 4D Lift is so popular.</p><p id=e7RzSVNoMqLN data-wc=45>“My 4D Lift focuses on replacing the volume of both bone and fat that depletes throughout the ageing process but also helps the skin to reduce in its physiological age&nbsp;through stimulation of collagen- the major&nbsp;component of skin health that also diminishes with time.</p><p id=ezmRsY24XzhR data-wc=42>“In suitable patients, replacing the three-dimensional loss of volume through expertly injected fillers can have an amazing rejuvenating effect on the whole face, as well as plumping the skin and supporting the tear trough to give a smoother, even toned under-eye appearance.</p><p id=e-wFCUr9NGX- data-wc=40>“We then cleverly utilise cutting edge collagen stimulating treatments including Morpheus8 from Inmode UK, and injectable biostimulators such as HArmoniCa and Polynucleotides which are able to reverse the clock of skin ageing and perfectly complement the benefits of volume replacement".</p><p id=eFisJA1aTobu data-wc=22>&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6735e9bf8306-gettyimages-809075426.jpg><h3><strong>Tweakment stacking for the jawline</strong></h3><p id=eQuNh1fEKWaO data-wc=29>Celebrity Aesthetic Doctor Sabika Karim and founder of <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopenernofollow nofollow">Skin Medical</a></span> says: “Creation of the perfect jawline is an art form that often takes a combination of treatments working together.</p><p id=eu1Bf451ZlPb data-wc=56>“The most common causes of a blurred jawline are loss of volume from the mandible (jawbone) and higher up in the face, masseteric hypertrophy (bulging muscles), excess fat under the skin (either in the face or under the chin) and loose or saggy skin. Sounds scary, but with a little help, these can all be helped.</p><p id=e7uSAvoaIjMc data-wc=24>“It’s important to get the right treatment and after consultation, I respond to the patients’ own anatomy to recommend the perfect portfolio of treatments.</p><p id=eD0_dKjdR-33 data-wc=43>“Sagging skin can be tightened with Secret RF needling radiofrequency combined with Ante-Age MD growth factors that stimulates collagen production in the skin, delivering a firmer, smoother and tighter skin, and because it’s your own collagen, the results last for years”, Sabika explains.</p><p id=elZwxCRHy1kp data-wc=59>“Double chins and pinchable jawline fat can be treated with fat dissolving injections such as Aqualyx, to sculpt the jawline and give definition, with long lasting results. Whereas bulging muscles can give some people a jawline that is too wide. If the muscles are overactive, they can be treated with anti-wrinkle injections to achieve a sleeker, more V-shaped face.</p><p id=elh6MLw5rGV1 data-wc=31>“Lastly, the loss of volume can be replaced by Maili dermal fillers placed strategically to help lift the face, to define chin and create the perfect lines for a sharp jawline.”<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Tweakments for beginners: an aesthetic doctor answers your most common questions" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/f01002508a91-tweakments-skin-clinic-header-2-1.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Tweakments for beginners: an aesthetic doctor answers your most common questions" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Tweakments for beginners: an aesthetic doctor answers your most common questions</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><h3><strong>Tweakment stacking for the neck and decolletage</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h3><p id=eSgLu5ie4iMH data-wc=41><span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopenernofollow nofollow">Teresa Tarmey</a></span>, Alma skincare expert says: “Recently, pigmentation, sun damage and correction of previous misuse of products are prevalent concerns from clients who visit my clinic. Crepey skin, loss of volume and dehydration are the number one neck concerns I see.&nbsp;</p><p id=erj1zetxDHbM data-wc=43>“As the neck has thinner skin, it tends to lose its firmness a lot quicker than the face. Fine lines are more noticeable because of dehydration. Clients often don’t take their skincare and SPF down to that area as much as they should.</p><p id=eAsu-7u7w6Xp data-wc=103>“Now clients are wanting to take care of their skin more as opposed to relying only on injectables. For necks particularly, I recommend stacking a combination of a light peel, gentle resurfacing for fine lines and a skin tightening treatment. The Opus Plasma RF is my go-to treatment mainly because unlike laser, this treatment is colourblind and is safe and effective to use on all skin tones. What also sets it apart from other resurfacing devices is that it works at speed and offers a much more comfortable treatment. Skin will also heal more quickly. These are top treatments that work well together.</p><p id=eydyzplpqNN7 data-wc=19></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaKqkoZ6YrrOxjJqlnWWWp66ovsCnmp6rX2p9eHyRb2awoJGpeqq%2FjK2unpmborKvwIysq5qbm567qHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./best-summer-jumpsuits.html><span>←</span><span>The Best Summer Jumpsuitsand How to Wear Them</span></a>
