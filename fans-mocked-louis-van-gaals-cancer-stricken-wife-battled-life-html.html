In his position in charge of Holland’s biggest football club he had access to all the best doctors and surgeons, but nothing could be done.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Instead, Van Gaal found himself confronted by challenges beyond his control. While he did his best to tend his wife in&nbsp; private, in public he had to show iron discipline as Dutch fans mocked their ordeal.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>In Holland, there are two words for woman. ‘Vrouw’ shows respect for a loving partner. ‘Wijf’ is insulting - translated as something like ‘bitch’.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>At one Ajax game, rival fans held a banner referring to his wife’s cancer. The placard read: ‘Van Gaal, heeft een kankerwijf’, which would roughly translate as ‘Van Gaal has a cancer bitch’. It must have hurt but he refused to let anybody see his anger.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>It was only 11 years later, in a rare interview about life outside football, he revealed the devastating effect the episode had on him. Asked to name ‘the last time you cried’, he admitted: ‘When my wife died in 1994.’</span></p><img id=i-5f01360d0450191b src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/07/21/article-2700505-1FDB89AC00000578-872_634x410.jpg height=410 width=634 alt="Tough to take: Van Gaal was mocked by Ajax's rival fans during his wife's illness but refused to show his anger" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Tough to take: Van Gaal was mocked by Ajax's rival fans during his wife's illness but refused to show his anger</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>There is still a picture of Fernanda - with whom Van Gaal had two daughters - in the house he shares now with his second wife, Truus.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>They met not long after&nbsp; Fernanda’s death and were&nbsp; partners for 14 years before Louis proposed in 2007.

It was important to me, not so important to him. He always regarded me as his wife but the media kept referring to me as “Louis’ girlfriend”. I didn’t like that.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>‘I wanted to go to Vegas, just the two of us, but Louis wanted a big celebration. He said: “If you have something to&nbsp; celebrate, then celebrate”. He was right. A secret marriage would have been wrong. His daughters from his first&nbsp; marriage belonged there as well.’</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>The home in Portugal remains their sanctuary. It was there that Manchester United officials&nbsp; travelled for talks within a few days of sacking David Moyes.Truus has looked at houses in Manchester to follow Van Gaal to his new job, even if she admits she would love to settle for the good life in the sunshine.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>She said: ‘Louis can’t help himself. He believes in himself and his methods. I’d thank the Lord if he quit.’</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Van Gaal is clearly as much the master of all he surveys at home as he is in his professional life.</span><br><span>‘At home he doesn’t do a thing in the house; he doesn’t even know how to make coffee,’ says Truus. ‘He likes me to spoil him and I like to do just that.’</span></p><p><span>But he does have a sentimental side. Talking about the picture of Fernanda in their living room, she says: ‘Why not? She is a grandma, too. I bought the two grandsons a little AZ jersey (while he was head coach at Alkmaar). You should have seen Louis’ face. Proud and emotional. Louis is a warm-blooded human being. It’s sad not a lot of people know this.’</span></p><img id=i-a0d36c13449f3823 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/07/21/article-2700505-1FCD4A2D00000578-75_634x406.jpg height=406 width=634 alt="New job: Van Gaal shares a smile with Man United striker Wayne Rooney during the club's tour of America" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>New job: Van Gaal shares a smile with Man United striker Wayne Rooney during the club's tour of America</p>&nbsp;<p><i><span>Adapted from Louis van Gaal by Maarten Meijer, published by Ebury, price £16.99.
