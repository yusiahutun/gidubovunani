The series cemented the 'friends just hanging out' mold that would come to define the genre for many years, with shows like <a href=#><strong>How I Met Your Mother</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>New Girl</strong></a> taking inspiration from the series, and sometimes being regarded as the Friends for their generation. The greatest contributing factor to the series' success was the stellar performances and chemistry of its ensemble cast, with characters that perfectly complemented one another for endless situational hilarity. It's hard to imagine any of those characters being played by anyone else as the cast firmly established their personas, but the casting process was long and there were many names considered for the parts. Joey Tribbiani, the suave and caring womanizer of the group, required a performer capable of balancing all of his best personality traits —which <strong><a href=#>Matt LeBlanc</a> </strong>managed to do with great success. However, <strong>before LeBlanc was cast, there were two other actors who auditioned for the rol</strong>e that would have immeasurably changed the dynamic of the entire series.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/friends-tv-show-poster.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title=Friends>Friends</a></h5>TV-14RomanceSitcom<p class=display-card-description>Ross Geller, Rachel Green, Monica Geller, Joey Tribbiani, Chandler Bing, and Phoebe Buffay are six twenty-somethings living in New York City.

In an interview on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>The Late Late Show</strong></a>, Azaria spoke with <strong><a href=#>James Corden</a> </strong>about his attempts — yes, attempts plural — to get cast as Joey Tribbiani. Azaria shared that he was close friends with <a href=#><strong>Matthew Perry</strong>, who played Chandler Bing</a>, and the two read the script and understood that the show was going to be great. Azaria auditioned for the role of Joey, but didn't get it. However, he was undeterred and earnestly wanted to be a part of the show, so he found his way to a second chance but was ultimately still rejected.</p><p>Though Azaria's multiple auditions for a main cast role on Friends weren't fruitful, he nonetheless got an opportunity to be featured on the show. In the first season, <strong>Azaria is introduced as David</strong>, a stuttering but sweet scientist who is in a romantic relationship with the eccentric Phoebe Buffay (<a href=#><strong>Lisa Kudrow</strong></a>). Unfortunately, their romance on Friends was short-lived as David left for Minsk for his work, leaving him absent from the show for several seasons. He would eventually return for a short time in Season 7 before making another, more impactful appearance in Season 9. By the penultimate season of the show, Phoebe is in a relationship with <a href=#>Mike Hannigan (<strong>Paul Rudd</strong></a>), though the two briefly break up because the former wants to get married while the latter does not. David's return, unfortunately for him, only confirms that Mike wants to be with Phoebe, and Phoebe wants to be with Mike. So, despite David's own attempt to propose to the cheerful guitarist, she ends up agreeing to marry Mike instead.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A behind-the-scenes look at the writing for this storyline revealed that David, like Azaria, might have gotten the short end of the stick yet again. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Azaria shared with HuffPost</a> that David's move to Minsk wasn't meant to be the end of his character's storyline, as he was always meant to return. He was also meant to resume his relationship with Phoebe, but the writers decided to keep her paired with Mike instead. While the story change did sting Azaria a little, he ultimately conceded that Rudd excelled in the role, even saying, “He’s a handsome devil. He’s actually annoyingly handsome. He shouldn’t really be allowed to be that handsome. He’s like the Tom Brady of comedy."</p><h2 id=vince-vaughn-was-considered-for-the-part-of-joey-tribbiani>Vince Vaughn Was Considered for the Part of Joey Tribbiani</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/vince-vaughn-in-dodgeball.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Azaria wasn't the only notable performer who could have possibly played Joey on the show. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>HuffPost</strong></a>, the series casting director <strong>Ellie Kanner</strong> spoke about the process of finding and choosing the ensemble cast, mentioning a name that has become notable in the comedy scene despite not getting this part. <strong><a href=#>Vince Vaughn</a> </strong>was one of the names on the list considered to play Joey, but this was years before Vaughn established himself as a big name. It was still the early 90s before Vaughn had his true breakout roles in films like <strong>Wedding Crashers </strong>and <a href=#><strong>Dodgeball</strong></a>. Kanner recalled her thought process about not going with Vaughn, noting that even though he was tall, handsome, and a good actor, "he just didn't fit the way Matt LeBlanc ended up fitting."</p><h2 id=matt-leblanc-brought-endearing-charm-and-heart-as-joey-even-getting-a-spinoff-show>Matt LeBlanc Brought Endearing Charm and Heart As Joey, Even Getting a Spinoff Show</h2><span class=txt>Close</span> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, the iconic role of <strong>Joey Tribbiani eventually went to the irreplaceable Matt LeBlanc </strong>and looking back, it truly feels like no one else could have played the role. Though Azaria joked in his interview with Corden that he, "imagined himself as Joey a lot," few can dispute that LeBlanc was a match made in heaven for the role and the group. Like all the characters on the show, Joey had multiple facets to his personality that LeBlanc was able to portray with endearing charm. Even though he was a bit of a playboy, Joey remained charming rather than creepy, and while he was more dim-witted than his peers, he was often able to share <a href=#>moments of unexpected wisdom</a>. Perhaps most importantly, LeBlanc was able to bring heart to the character, whose loyalty and care for his friends defined him more than anything else. LeBlanc's chemistry with the rest of the cast was top-notch, helping to create the <a href=#>funniest duo on the series</a> with Joey and Chandler.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The story behind LeBlanc's audition was also full of off-screen hilarity that ended up helping him secure the part. During the <strong>Friends: The Reunion</strong> special, LeBlanc talked about a <strong>drunken accident before the night of his Friends audition that ultimately contributed to landing him the role</strong> of Joey. The night before one of his auditions, his friend had urged him to go out for drinks in preparation for a show about friends hanging out. Later that night, and several drinks in, LeBlanc recalled getting up to use the bathroom before stumbling and falling, hitting his head on the toilet. While he was ultimately okay, the accident left him with an injury to his nose that was apparent when he went in for the audition. However, it was a blessing in disguise as during his audition for Joey, LeBlanc told the story about the injury to his face, and it was so well-received that it confirmed he was the right man for the job. LeBlanc even got the opportunity to play Joey past the series end in a <a href=#>short-lived spinoff show</a> simply called <strong>Joey</strong>, which was created just for everyone's favorite friend.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Friends is streaming now on Max.</p><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch Now</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibn6G5qrDEq2Wcp51ks7O1xKebrGWapLK6ecKaqq2hnpx8</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ffriends-joey-casting.html&text=Joey%20Tribbiani%20Almost%20Looked%20Very%20Different%20on%20%27Friends%27&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffriends-joey-casting.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffriends-joey-casting.html&title=Joey%20Tribbiani%20Almost%20Looked%20Very%20Different%20on%20%27Friends%27" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ffriends-joey-casting.html&title=Joey%20Tribbiani%20Almost%20Looked%20Very%20Different%20on%20%27Friends%27" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ffriends-joey-casting.html&title=Joey%20Tribbiani%20Almost%20Looked%20Very%20Different%20on%20%27Friends%27" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffriends-joey-casting.html&description=Joey%20Tribbiani%20Almost%20Looked%20Very%20Different%20on%20%27Friends%27" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./local-candy-store-closes-its-doors.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Local candy store closes its doors">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./why-mission-impossible-dead-reckoning-is-2-movies-christopher-mcquarrie.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Impossible Dead Reckoning Is 2 Movies According to Director">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
