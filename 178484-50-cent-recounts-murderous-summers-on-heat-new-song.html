Within 16 years, he's transformed from a controversial rapper to a certified entertainment mogul. Although he hasn't aged that well as an emcee, his early albums still have a ton of replay album today. "Heat" was one of the many highlights off of his debut album. With production from <a href=# class=text-word rel>Dr. Dre</a>, 50 Cent detailed the ongoings of the hood in the summer. "In the hood, summertime is the killing season/ It's hot out in this bitch, that's a good enough reason," he mercilessly declares three bars into the first verse.&nbsp;</p><p>50 Cent is far from the street hustler who got his name off of mixtapes but his unapologetic attitude on the song is still a characteristic that we see from the rapper in different forms today. "Heat" wasn't released as a single but it was still an impactful record. Although based on reality, the content in the song was so&nbsp;GTA-like, that he included it in his video,&nbsp;50 Cent: Bulletproof.&nbsp;If&nbsp;you're diving into a fictional world where you're playing 50 Cent as a vigilante, it's pretty solid theme music.&nbsp;</p><p><span><strong>Quotable Lyrics<br></strong></span>I done made myself a millionaire by myself<br>Now shit changed, mothafucka, I could hire some help<br>I done heard about the fifty grand you put in the hood<br>But your shooter finna get shot, it won't do him no good</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdhbIV1hJNmbGllk5q7tXnRnpqorZ6pwG651KubnqqfqsBuv9SmpJ6qo2K8r3nHnpitZZ6axG6%2Fzqee</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./red-table-talk-willow-smith-savage-fenty.html><span>←</span><span>Why Willow Smith Had Doubts About Doing Savage X Fenty Runway</span></a>
