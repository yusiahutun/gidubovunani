Speaking about her and François-Henri's first interaction in a 2019 interview, Salma gushed: "It’s such a romantic, amazing story."</p><p id=e6gpTQsHQ2q1 data-wc=39>However, she then explained that it was one which she wanted to stay just between the couple.

"It was like an intervention," Salma said. "My parents, my brother, they were all ganging up on me [because] I had a phobia of the marriage thing."</p><p id=eK2MpRzb9hVl data-wc=72>Thankfully, following the sudden ceremony, Salma found she was very happy with her newly deepened relationship with François-Henri. The couple chose to <a class=hm-link href=#>renew their vows</a> a couple of months later in Venice at a far more organised ceremony – and one which ended up being one of the most expensive celebrity weddings in history, with Salma's dress alone <a class=hm-link href=#>costing around $488,000</a>. They then renewed their vows again in Bora Bora in 2018.</p><h2>What does Salma Hayek's husband own?</h2><p id=eSCvYPrf8iym data-wc=34>Salma Hayek's husband François-Henri is the proud chairman and CEO of the French luxury goods company Kering.

François-Henri took over the company from his father in 2005 when it was primarily focused on retail and entitled Pinault-Printemps-Redoute. The company changed its name to Kering in 2013 as François-Henri successfully steered it further into the luxury world.</p><p id=eAV4tWrjsi2m data-wc=11><strong>SEE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Salma Hayek is unrecognizable in throwback photo nobody was expecting</a></strong></p><p id=eDH8ZQRA9JLp data-wc=49>In order to diversify Kering's work and influence beyond just managing its brands, the company launched the Women in Motion campaign at the Cannes Film Festival in 2015 and has been awarding a prize from women making a difference in the screen industry at the festival each year since.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7778f1399245-salma-hayek-blue-sparkly-dress.jpg><p id=eAVPgs21Ujsy data-wc=33>The brand has also been working to improve sustainability within the fashion industry, and appointed <a class=hm-link href=#>actress and activist Emma Watson</a> as one of the independent members of its board of directors in 2020.</p><p id=eDwBplc9OhLB data-wc=31>Kering is also a strategic partner of Chime for Change, an international campaign focused on women's education, health and justice which Salma launched alongside Gucci's former CEO Frida Giannini, and Beyoncé.</p><h2>What is Salma Hayek's husband's net worth?</h2><p id=e815kRYD2tot data-wc=30>As the owner of the hugely successful corporation Kering, François-Henri is worth a staggering $7billion. With this sum, the 60-year-old is currently one of the richest people in the world.</p><p id=e_-CyJsLWzcd data-wc=28>However, François-Henri's net worth doesn't come close to that of his father, 86, who was ranked the sixth richest person in Europe in <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Forbes</a>' 2022 list, at $40billion.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/11dc96c5ca36-francois-henri-salma-francois.jpg><p id=eN0OWeZqagku data-wc=42>Alongside his work running Kering, François-Henri is also the president of the holding company Groupe Artemis, which was also set up by his father.
