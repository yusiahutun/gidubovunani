Update – in 2023, they had another son, Oliver.</p><p>Most of the family’s videos focus on the mainstream attractions—places like Disney’s Magic Kingdom, Legoland, Universal Studios, Disney’s Typhoon Lagoon, and Universal Island Adventure.</p><p>There are a few off the beaten track gems to be found on the family-friendly channel, and a few that go totally off-brand—like <a href=# rel=noopener>this trip to Knott’s Berry Farm in California</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>pregnancy vlogs like this one</a>—but most of the time, the Trackers stay pretty true to what made them internet famous in the first place.</p><p>The thing with being internet famous these days is that everyone wants to know about your personal life.</p><p>The Trackers are no exception.</p><p>There’s a lot that eagle-eyed viewers want to know, and the questions definitely seem to get a little personal from time to time.</p><p>From the old classic “why don’t Tim and Jenn have a baby?” to “how long have Tim Tracker and Jenn been together?” to “Where did Tim and Jenn get married?” to the more recent “why doesn’t Tim Tracker drink alcohol?” there’s a lot of people want to dig into.</p><p>So, we’re answering these three most popular questions for you right here.</p><h2><strong>How long have Tim Tracker and his wife been together?</strong></h2><p>Tim Tracker has known his wife since the pair were in high school.</p><p>They were both in relationships with other people at the time.</p><p>It wasn’t until Tim was freshly out of college that the pair reconnected.</p><p>At the time, Jenn’s mom was sick, and she had come home to Orlando from college to care for her temporarily.</p><p>Needing a place to stay, she reached out to a few people—and Tim raised his hand.</p><p>In his words, “…then the 2004 hurricanes happened, and we started dating.”</p><p>It was Halloween of that year when they officially decided they were a couple.</p><p>Jenn often jokes that the pair got stuck inside together for so long that they just started dating, and that they’ve lived together longer than they’ve dated.</p><p>After dating for 6 years, Tim made a plan to propose to his girlfriend. He would do it at sunset, on a beach, and it would all be very romantic. Jenn, who didn’t suspect anything at the time, refused to drive “three hours just to go to a dumb beach and see a stupid sunset.”</p><p>Instead, she said, she wanted to just go out for dinner at a local restaurant.</p><p>They did, and Tim proposed there instead.</p><p>They were married at Hogwarts at the Universal Studios complex in Orlando on June 3, 2011.</p><p>As poetic and fitting as it may be, it wasn’t the couple’s first choice.</p><p>They chose The Incredible Hulk roller coaster first, but were unable to get permission to film on the ride.</p><p>Their second choice was Ollivander’s wand shop at Universal Studios, but Warner Bros. do not allow filming there. The pair landed on Hogwarts, instead.</p><p>Tim and Jenn got a dog together—a little Dachshund named Armani, who passed away just after Christmas in 2016.</p><p>The heartbroken pair eventually welcomed a new pup into their home—the now YouTube famous Bandit—a while later.</p><h2><strong>Why don’t Tim and Jenn have a baby?</strong></h2><p>This was possibly the most asked question the pair faced up until the birth of their son Jackson 15 years into their relationship.</p><p>In a series of vlogs on the TheTimTracker channel, Jenn said that the question was invasive and “sometimes hurtful […] like having 200,000 mother-in-laws ask why aren’t you pregnant yet?”</p><p>The couple did discuss their struggles to have a baby quite openly with fans.</p><p>In May 2019, the couple announced on YouTube that they were having a baby.</p><p>They had found out the exciting news prior to a trip to Hawaii.</p><p>While most fans were over the moon for the couple, given their fertility struggles up to that point, some were very unsupportive.</p><p>Jenn took a step back from social media after the couple’s gender reveal video in July of that year, saying that she was doing it for her “wellbeing and for the wellbeing of our baby.”</p><p>Jackson was born on November 29, 2019.</p><p>The pair <a href=# rel=noopener>announced they were pregnant with their second child</a> on August 10, 2022.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong> <a href=#>How much are The Island Boys worth</a>?</p><h2><strong>Why doesn’t Tim Tracker drink alcohol?<img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Why-doesnt-Tim-Tracker-drink-alcohol.jpg.webp alt="Why doesn’t Tim Tracker drink alcohol" width=1200 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Why-doesnt-Tim-Tracker-drink-alcohol.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-1 data-svg=1 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></strong></h2><p>Tim and Jenn have had a career on YouTube for over a decade now, and in the last 5 years a few fans have noticed that Tim didn’t appear to be drinking alcohol in any of the couple’s vlogs.</p><p>While Jenn has occasionally been spotted enjoying a beer when they’re not on parent duty, Tim looks to be alcohol-free.</p><p>In one video, Tim explained that he didn’t like the way he came across on camera when he’d had a few drinks.</p><p>With their brand being family-friendly, it would make sense that he wanted to protect that image.</p><p>There is also a suggestion that he made the decision for health reasons, especially with the couple trying for so long to conceive, and with Tim’s focus on health and well-being.</p><p><strong>READ THIS NEXT:</strong> <a href=#>Why did Milburn Stone leave Gunsmoke for a while</a>?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaK8tr%2FPnqappJWpvKWt2GeaqKVfrLW6ecOonKympGLBqrmMramam5uav26w0aKlpGWRobCwtM6lZg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhy-doesnt-tim-tracker-drink-alcohol.html&text=Why%20doesnt%20Tim%20Tracker%20drink%20alcohol%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-doesnt-tim-tracker-drink-alcohol.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-doesnt-tim-tracker-drink-alcohol.html&title=Why%20doesnt%20Tim%20Tracker%20drink%20alcohol%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhy-doesnt-tim-tracker-drink-alcohol.html&title=Why%20doesnt%20Tim%20Tracker%20drink%20alcohol%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-doesnt-tim-tracker-drink-alcohol.html&title=Why%20doesnt%20Tim%20Tracker%20drink%20alcohol%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-doesnt-tim-tracker-drink-alcohol.html&description=Why%20doesnt%20Tim%20Tracker%20drink%20alcohol%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./treasure-hunter-trophy-treasure-map-locations.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="God of War Treasure Hunter Trophy">&larr;
