What we fail to recognize is that mineral buildup is the reason we need some of these products to begin with. With that being said, knowing <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">how to fix hard water hair damage</a> is a non-negotiable.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/prose-hair-fi.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/renehairgrowthserum.png><h2>What is Hard Water?</h2><p>You may have heard your colorist warn you of the harmful effects of so-called “hard water,” but what exactly is it? In short, it’s the unfiltered tap water we use when we shower. It’s usually contaminated with mineral (mostly calcium and magnesium) buildup that creates a barrier of film on the hair over time, thereby blocking adequate moisture for the follicles. Ultimately, this renders our <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">pricey conditioners</a> ineffective and leads to dryness, frizz and accelerated breakage. It also effects your scalp health and can even cause itchy, eczema-like symptoms and dandruff.</p><p>Hard water is specifically a nightmare for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">color-treated hair</a>, as the buildup can lead to premature color fading and brassiness. According to California-based colorist <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Jamie Garland</a>, “hard water is a colorist’s worst nightmare. Not only is hard water harsh on your skin and hair, but it can actually change your hair color.” In addition to hair-wrecking minerals like copper, iron and calcium, it can also contain toxic lead and chlorine.</p><h2>The Indicator</h2><p>Aside from assessing the condition of your hair, one surefire indicator that your shower is spewing hard water is by simply looking around you. If you’ve noticed excess soap scum that, regardless of how often you thoroughly clean and scrub, isn’t budging–that’s probably it. And while you could go the extra mile with filtered or bottled water while <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">washing your hair</a>, this option is not only wildly inconvenient but also terribly wasteful.</p><h2>The Solutions</h2><p>Instead, hairstylists and colorists seem to unanimously agree that investing in a solid water filter is the easiest way to protect your hair (and skin) from hard water. “The best thing to do is to [install] a shower filter,” says <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Garland</a>. Her favorite? “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">RAINDROPS901</a> ($95) is a six-step filtration process. It’s like a Brita for your hair!” In order to make sure your shower filter stays effective, Garland advises changing it every few months. “This will help reverse and protect against future damage.”</p><p>While adding a water filter to your shower head is paramount for avoiding and getting rid of hard water’s effects, there are some other treatments and products that can help accelerate the healing process as well. “My other go-to is the Hard Water Malibu shampoos and conditioners. If you’re investing in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">beautiful hair color</a>, protect the investment with these products,” she advises. Ahead, we’ve outlined more stylist-approved remedies to help you blast away mineral buildup.
