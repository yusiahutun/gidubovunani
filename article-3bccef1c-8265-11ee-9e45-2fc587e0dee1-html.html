The cost of insuring property in the district — which includes areas in and around Sandersville, Rustin, Myrick/Mill Creek, Glade and Powers — may now be a little lower after the improvement, saving taxpayers money on their premiums.</p><p>Gordon Pitts, president of the Jones County Fire Council, commended the men and women who serve as volunteers but work as professional firefighters for the Northeast Jones Fire District.</p><p>“Their hard work and dedication made this achievement possible for the citizens of Jones County,” Pitts said. “My belief is there is not a better group of people to serve alongside than the volunteers of the Jones County fire service.”</p><p>Firefighters worked with the Mississippi State Rating Bureau to get this upgraded classification. Fire departments had to meet stringent requirements, including documented training, records related to fire equipment and emergency calls, operating under up-to-date standard operating guidelines and, most recently, fire departments demonstrated a continuous water supply through a water shuttle exercise that was completed for the rating bureau officials.</p><p>New fire engines were recently purchased, and that helped with the better rating, but the credit for the achievement goes to the “committed firefighters in the county who work so hard to make sure the county has adequate fire protection,” said Dana Bumgardner, spokeswoman for the Jones County Fire Council. “Suffice it to say, there were many requirements detailed by the rating bureau, and firefighters worked for months to meet those requirements and achieve the improved class.”</p><p>Jones County Fire Coordinator Kyle Brooks also thanked those who serve in the Northeast Jones district for their “hard work and dedication to working towards this improvement for the citizens of Jones County and also the Jones County Board of Supervisors for their financial support in securing funding for new fire engines.”</p><p>Anyone who lives in Jones County and is interested in volunteering with the fire service is asked to contact Dana Bumgardner at <a href=#>piojonesfire@gmail.com</a> or on Facebook (Jones County MS Fire & Rescue) or Instagram (@jonescountyfirerescue).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKaVrMBwstGenJimlazAcMLOpaynrJWav7R5waugp59dmby4uoyfoKudXaeutbXNoGSfp6Jiv6a%2FyJ2cp6yjZK6zwMico56XY5ewpLHFappmcGJrgm59kJ6cZnGVaYJufsWcbHFvlWWxprGQZ5%2BtpZw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sarah-michelle-gellar.html><span>←</span><span>Sarah Michelle Gellar - Biography</span></a>
