"In these friendly trusting islands, locked doors were obsolete," Biggers writes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Enter the victim's nephew, John Quincy Winterslip. The staid young Bostonian bond trader plans to persuade his hedonistic aunt Minerva to return to Boston before her Hawaii holiday becomes a permanent fixture. But Quincy soon becomes attached to the tropical islands and stays on, too, to support the murder investigation, which is propelled by a humble but canny detective, Charlie Chan.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Biggers' take on the detective and, by extension, Asians in general, is progressive for its time. While the Bostonians who grace the story are uneasy about an Asian pursuing the case, locals treat Charlie with respect because they know he is good at his job. The crack detective is loosely based on a real Honolulu gumshoe, Chang Apana: a tough character who sustained his signature facial scar when a Japanese leper he was expelling lashed out with a sickle.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Charlie is less imposing than his true-life counterpart. "He was very fat indeed, yet he walked with the light dainty steps of a woman. His cheeks were as chubby as a baby's, his skin ivory tinted, his black hair close-cropped, his amber eyes slanting," Biggers writes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Charlie can seem like a yellow Uncle Tom prone to fortune-cookie philosophising and in the end, Quincy upstages the modest cop, nabbing the killer. Still, Charlie, who does much of the legwork, comes across as charming and shrewd. Quincy's cousin calls him the best detective in the force.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Charlie's Harvard graduate creator clearly meant him to come over well. "I had seen movies depicting and read stories about Chinatown and wicked Chinese villains, and it struck me that a Chinese hero, trustworthy, benevolent, and philosophical, would come nearer to presenting a correct portrayal of the race," Biggers told</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Charlie Chan evolved into a dubious but brilliant cinema icon - a super-sleuth capable of finding the key to any mystery.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZK6zwMico55nYWt9eYSUcGarnaeeu6V5waimpGWYpMK0sYywoK2gn6rBbrfEsmSemaKheqWx0atkm6GXnLKzv4xqcGtt</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./article-132eeff4-4518-11e9-8a29-cb6896ab9e19-html.html><span>←</span><span>Melanie Shawn Casey Red | Obituaries</span></a>
