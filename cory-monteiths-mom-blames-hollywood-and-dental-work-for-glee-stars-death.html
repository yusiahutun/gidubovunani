He learned to read at the age of 3 and therefore skipped two grades in school. He began hanging out with an older crowd by his early teens. Monteith began drinking and smoking marijuana when he was 13. He went to rehab for the first time at the age of 15. He went again at 19.</p><p>"There was this disconnect because he was pushed so far ahead and always associated with older children, but he was still a boy," McGregor said of her son.</p><p>McGregor, who took Monteith to rehab both times, said, "He tried to keep everything from me because he loved me and wanted to protect me. He was just always so curious. And the darker world just drew him in."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:b2c39452-a65a-56c4-a521-c01796ec7b35 data-container-ref=toofab:article:6789af63-8d39-57d2-89fa-9a4ff312488e data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/04/5by4/2018/06/21/0433038b1e4258179f90885035717802_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">XXXTentacion's Controversial and Violent Past Divides Fans Even as Alleged Killer is Arrested</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Eventually, Monteith got sober and moved to Los Angeles, where he landed a starring role on "Glee." McGregor believes his move was detrimental to his sobriety.</p><p>"He wasn't ready for the Hollywood world," she said, acknowledging that her son began using drugs again in December 2012, seven months before his death. "Drugs were his way of checking out."</p><p>Monteith checked into a month-long rehab facility in April 2013, but between May and July of that year, he underwent "massive" dental work that McGregor believes also affected Monteith's sobriety.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:3a56e257-f075-567e-bf09-9104b889700b data-container-ref=toofab:article:6789af63-8d39-57d2-89fa-9a4ff312488e data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/5d/5by4/2018/07/14/5dec2059d36e51798b42aa189a22c3c0_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Halsey Gushes About G-Eazy in Awkwardly Timed Marie Claire Interview: 'I Love Everything About Him'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><h2 class=h2>The Pain Meds Following the Dental Work</h2><p>McGregor believes Monteith's dental procedures and subsequently prescribed pain medications were the final straw for her son, whose body was discovered in a Vancouver hotel room on July 13 with traces of morphine, codeine and heroin in his system.</p><p>"He had little teeth and they were all capped," McGregor explained.</p><p>"He had a lot of medication in his system, which was not good for his body coming out of rehab. He didn't have enough drugs in his system to kill him, but for some reason, it did because of his intolerance [built up by periods of intermittent sobriety]," she claimed.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:123f2df3-1841-59fe-b9e8-9848e23995d5 data-container-ref=toofab:article:6789af63-8d39-57d2-89fa-9a4ff312488e data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/c6/5by4/2018/06/05/c6af41df8d345afe81019c57a5b01808_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Stars Mourn Fashion Designer Kate Spade After Apparent Suicide</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><h2 class=h2>Lea Michele Was the One Who Broke the News</h2><p>McGregor can still recall the chilling moment she heard that her son had died.</p><p>"I got a call from Lea [Michele, Monteith's girlfriend of over a year], and she was screaming on the phone," she said. "She was yelling, 'Is it true?! Is it true about Cory?!' And I said, 'What about Cory?' I had heard nothing. And then police knocked on my front door."</p><p>McGregor said she "went into a state of numbness" when she heard the news.</p><p>"I knew it was real, but there were times when I could lie to myself and say, 'He's in L.A. He'll call me soon,'" she said of dealing with the aftermath. "I'm still always hanging on edge. When you lose someone who is such a big part of you, you lose all purpose for living."</p><a id=gallery-link-90575a61-c2b2-5c43-9156-a189b1296703 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:90575a61-c2b2-5c43-9156-a189b1296703 data-poster-image-ref=toofab:image-asset:image_jpg_20180607_b65f18f38eb65214902074d40e126941 data-start-at-poster data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:6789af63-8d39-57d2-89fa-9a4ff312488e data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/b6/4by3/2018/06/07/b65f18f38eb65214902074d40e126941_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit gallery-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlfnl7j3BmanBfmLyzxYympqeslZ7Bqb%2BMpqamZZKhrq6x0mafqKScrsSwu8NmmKecXZmyr8DApWSwp6Kgeqe70WaepZ2VYsC1rdGsZJ2dkam1cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ashley-graham-goes-fully-nude-30722297.html><span>←</span><span>Ashley Graham goes fully nude as she shows off red marks on back in new holiday snap</span></a>
