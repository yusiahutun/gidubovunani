Now age&nbsp;26, he stands five feet and five inches in height.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Behind Ian Corner's Net Worth</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Despite his shorter stature, Ian made a name for himself as a fashion model. Modeling for reputed brands such as Kanye West's Yeezys, <a href=# rel=follow>Drake</a>'s OVO fashion line, Bape as well as Midnight Studios. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p style=text-align:justify>He rose to prominence in 2012 as a stylish through Tumblr.

To him, romance is as much a routine as it is a pure biological need. In 2015 Complex interview, he explained:-</p><p style=text-align:justify>"Nah, I like what I like. I could fu** the baddest of the bad, I could fu** the wackest of the wack. Either way, it’s the same thing: I’m getting my nut. You’re a physical being.
