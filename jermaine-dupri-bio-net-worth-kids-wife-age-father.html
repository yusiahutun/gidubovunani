Although his hometown is Asheville, North Carolina, he was raised in Atlanta following his father’s career in the entertainment industry.&nbsp;Dupri’s journey to fame began at a young age.&nbsp;Guided by his father, the rap star’s musical inclinations were gradually refined and established for the highly competitive music industry.&nbsp;Even before he was a teenager, Dupri was performing alongside top shots in the industry.&nbsp;He became part of a hip hop dance group called Whodini.&nbsp;Jermaine’s guest with the dance company saw him tour and perform at various events around the country.</span></p><p><span>Today, JD or Don Chi Chi as he is also known is a well known rapper and record producer/executive.&nbsp;However, few people know that Dupri once owned a business – rap Corna Guuds, before finally choosing his career as a rapper.&nbsp;Jermaine made his debut as a producer in 1990 with a female hip hop trio called Silk Tymes Leather.&nbsp;Shortly thereafter followed his next production for the group Kriss Kross, consisting of the duo Chris Smith and Chris Kelly.&nbsp;Dupri got his big break in 1993 when he started his own So So Def label.&nbsp;Jermaine’s first act under his new label was female R&B group Xscape, whose debut album&nbsp;</span><span>Hummin’ Comin</span><span>was a great success.&nbsp;Shortly thereafter, Dupri’s label signed a distribution partnership deal with Columbia Records, but after a few successful years, the deal was canceled and Dupri moved to Arista Records.</span></p><p><span>Alongside his debut album&nbsp;</span><span>Life in 1472</span><span>&nbsp;and consequently&nbsp;</span><span>Instruction</span><span>&nbsp;, the American rapper has been working with the industry’s top recordings to produce super hits.&nbsp;Of particular note are collaborations with Destiny Child, Usher, Aretha Franklin, Mariah Carey, Alicia Keys, Janet Jackson, Xscape, Lil Kim and Migos.&nbsp;In 2015, Dupri and Queen Latifah successfully launched&nbsp;The Rap Game,&nbsp;a reality TV series on Lifetime that discovers and trains new talent in the competitive industry.</span></p><p><span>Jermaine Dupri’s contributions and hard work in the industry have paid off, earning him multiple recognitions both locally and around the world.&nbsp;To date, the rapper has been nominated four times for the prestigious Grammy Awards, winning a 2006 hit for Best R&B Song of the Year with his hit&nbsp;</span><span>We Belong Here</span><span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;In 2008, Jermaine was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame.</span></p><h2><strong><span>His capital</span></strong></h2><p><span>Jermaine Dupri was once considered one of the richest in the business.&nbsp;The rapper, record producer and songwriter’s current net worth is estimated at $2 million, which is a rusty number compared to his financial value in the early 2000s.</span></p><p><span>Dupri suffered a huge loss in 2013 when he defaulted on a loan agreement and was subsequently sued by SunTrust Bank.&nbsp;Since then, he has endured many more financial woes, including losing his Atlanta home in 2014. Despite this, Dupri continues to grow strongly in the industry and hopes to make a meaningful financial comeback soon.</span></p><h2><strong><span>father, wife and children</span></strong></h2><p><span>Jermaine Dupri didn’t fall far from his tree when he apparently inherited his father’s business and entrepreneurial genes.&nbsp;He is the son of Tina Mauldin and Michael Mauldin, a well-known musician from the 90’s.&nbsp;Additionally, Dupri’s father boasts a reputation as a successful entrepreneur, talent manager and music promoter, all of which are undaunted testaments to his business acumen.&nbsp;Michael was instrumental in his son’s career choice.&nbsp;Thanks to his father, Jermaine’s musical career began before he was ten and he was allowed to perform alongside Diana Ross in 1982.&nbsp;In addition, Michael was of immense support in founding the rapper label So So Def.</span></p><p><span>Jermaine Dupri has never been married but had an interesting dating history.&nbsp;Over the years, the rapper has been in a number of high-profile, headline-grabbing relationships.&nbsp;His first notable relationship was with Pam Sweat.&nbsp;Although the ex-lovers never made it, they share one child, a daughter named Shaniah Cymone who was born in 1998.</span></p><p><span>Next came Jermaine’s longtime relationship with pop singer Janet Jackson.&nbsp;Dupri and Janet were so into each other and even had a collaboration on their 2005 album,&nbsp;</span><span>20 YO</span><span>&nbsp;. Their romance later morphed into an engagement at some point but after 8 years together (2001-2009) they called it quits.&nbsp;However, in the fall of 2017, unconfirmed reports surfaced speculating that the former lovers had reignited their flame, but neither party had publicly addressed the speculation.</span></p><p><span>Dupri probably hasn’t found the kind of love to put up with it and continue to freely enjoy the perks of single life.&nbsp;The rap star is also the father of another child, a daughter he fathered with an Atlanta-based woman, Sarai Jones.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><span class=vce-square></span><h2 class=entry-title><a href=# title="Who is Cassandra Marino?
