<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>UTMB and Ironman join forces for World Series and pathway to Chamonix, replacing ITRA points and Ult</h1></header><section class=post-content><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To qualify for the finals, all runners will have to complete at least one World Series event, gaining one ‘running stone’ – a ticket for the lottery to get a place in Chamonix. The more World Series events a runner completes, the more running stones they get and the higher are their chances of winning the lottery.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Running stones have no expiration date. Runners can accumulate them over the years and then decide when to activate all of them together in a single lottery event. The system is exactly the same for both elite and amateur runners, but the top three finishers in the World Series events gain automatic entry to the UTMB in Chamonix.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2021/05/07/f0cde916-ae0f-11eb-9c9f-63ba12e765d1_1320x770_131438.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The World Series will also feature three races called UTMB World Series Majors – championships for Asia-Oceania, the Americas and Europe-Africa. The top-10 finishers will be awarded direct entry into the UTMB in Chamonix, while all finishers will double their lottery chances.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The UTMB Group has confirmed eight World Series events. Three are in Europe – UTMB Mont-Blanc that straddles France, Italy and Switzerland; the Mozart 100 in Austria; and the Val d‘Aran in Spain. Three are in Asia – in Thailand, and the Panda Trail and Gaoligong in China. Two are in Oceania – the Tarawera Ultramarathon in New Zealand and the Ultra-Trail Australia.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Mud-caked ‘enjoyment’ for 2,700 runners as UTMB returns to China</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tarawera and Ultra-Trail Australia are owned by Ironman Group.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There are no North American events confirmed yet. UTMB Group president and UTMB co-founder Catherine Poletti told the Post they are negotiating with several, but pointed at the transatlantic divide. “American trail runners do not understand trail running the same way we (Europeans) do,” she said, but confirmed that there will be events in North America as part of the series.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">China is the only country so far with more than one event. Beth Hodge, senior account manager for Asia-Pacific at UTMB Group, said more events are in the works. “China is super important for us. We are now looking for new, unique locations that China can offer,” she said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2021/05/07/48b3f1e8-ae10-11eb-9c9f-63ba12e765d1_1320x770_131438.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Vibram Hong Kong 100 is on the UTWT. Will there be a World Series event in Hong Kong?</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We recognise how passionate the trail running community in Hong Kong is,” said Hodge. “There are world-class events in Hong Kong already, but we are always open to opportunities here.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To take part in World Series events, runners will have to achieve a certain UTMB performance index – points that are earned by completing races designated as qualifiers. Poletti said there will be more than 3,000 qualifiers. There are no fees for race organisers who want their race to become a qualifier, but they must comply with certain standards.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2021/05/07/fd60740a-ae0f-11eb-9c9f-63ba12e765d1_972x_131438.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Currently, the performance index that trail runners are familiar with is maintained by the International Trail Running Association. ITRA has been using the UTMB-made formula to calculate it, but the agreement between UTMB and ITRA ends at the end of May.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“ITRA prefer to have their own formula, so now it will be our performance index, and we will operate it directly,” said Poletti.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“There will be prize money, but it will remain reasonable (as a fair recognition of what the athletes bring to the event) and in line with what offer for UTMB Mont Blanc for example. The amount has not been announced yet and we will be doing this in the autumn,” said Poletti.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Spartan Trail’s approach is a snub to UTMB and UTWT</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One of the reasons for creating the World Series, Poletti said, was the proliferation of series and titles in the sport.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“In 2019, there were five world championships. There was UTWT, there was UTMB International with the “by UTMB” races, there were new arrivals like Spartan. I think it was a little bit confusing.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Another reason is to bring UTMB-quality events and experience directly to people wherever they may be in the world. The UTMB in Chamonix became a victim of its own success – both the race and the location, according to Poletti, cannot cope with the demand, even with 10,000 runners winning spots at one of the seven races in Chamonix.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“At UTMB, in 2017 we had about 18,000 (bib) requests, in 2018 – more than 24,000, in 2019 more than 32,000. In Chamonix Valley it is impossible to welcome more people than we do now. To have a once-a-year, single event where everyone comes together is not sustainable.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Poletti said the new system for getting a place at UTMB is simpler: “With 30 World Series events, runners are able to find a race near where they are, and they don’t have to take part in many races – they just need to finish one race [to enter the lottery].”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She said that the new system where running stones do not have an expiration date is also more practical in the times of the Covid-19 pandemic: “In the next three years, travel will be unpredictable”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Runners will be able to retain the running stones they earned in local events until there is a secure opportunity to travel to UTMB Mont Blanc, she added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1mqK2kmbywvo6tqZqhnGK%2FtrrNoqWgZ5Gnwaqvy55mbGljZ4F1f46uq6aaXZa7pXnIq6anpZGjequ7yKdkn6eimLK0edaoqaWcXaiys7XErGSappRivaLAx7CYsg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-red-tape-and-outdated-attitudes-hamper-hong-kongs-marine-waste-clean.html><span>←</span><span>Hong Kongs marine waste clean-up mired in red tape and outdated attitudes</span></a>
