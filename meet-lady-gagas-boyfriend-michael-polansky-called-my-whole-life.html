So who is Lady Gaga’s boyfriend?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>While fans can’t help but be enthralled by Lady Gaga’s performance in “House of Gucci,” there’s also been some attention on her love life. Gaga has been linked with her lover, Michael Polansky, since the 2019 yuletide season and has been riding the waves of love.&nbsp;</p><p>The Grammy-winning singer known for her private lifestyle has also debuted him on her Instagram page. However not much about Polansky is known, except for his multi-million dollar organizations. So who’s the man that stole the fashion queen’s heart?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Gaga-and-Polansky.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=who-is-lady-gaga-s-boyfriend><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_is_Lady_Gagas_Boyfriend></span>Who is Lady Gaga’s Boyfriend?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Michael Polansky is <a href=#>a Havard graduate </a>with an impressive administrative resume. Since graduating from the ivy league college, Polansky has worked side-by-side with Facebook and Napster co-founder Sean Parker.&nbsp;</p><p>He runs Parker’s Institute of <a href=#>Cancer</a> Immunotherapy and has served as the CEO for The Parker Group. The business executive also co-founded The Parker Foundation and is a managing partner in Parker Ventures.</p><p>Polansky’s business dealings run deep. According to The Parker Cancer Immunotherapy website, he serves on the six-person panel. The panel is charged with the duty of breaking challenges against cancer research.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-did-polansky-and-gaga-become-a-thing><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Did_Polansky_and_Gaga_Become_A_Thing></span>How Did Polansky and Gaga Become A Thing?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Polansky’s relationship with Gaga started on a sizzling New Years’ Eve, as the pair prepared to go into the year 2020 in grand style. The two were spotted, getting cozy in Las Vegas.</p><p>Prior to their Vegas rendezvous, sources shared with <a href=#>Page Six</a> that Gaga and Polansky met through Parker. The two attended his birthday party in 2019, and that was when they first connected.&nbsp;</p><p>The duo would later make it to the News after <a href=#>Us Magazine </a>confirmed that Polansky had attended the “Born This Way” singer’s Super Bowl performance. This was two months after their Vegas PDA-filled outing.&nbsp;</p><p>In the same month, he was at her Superbowl performance; the lovebirds celebrated their first Valentine’s. A source later confirmed to Us Magazine that the celebrity couple was having fun and things were getting serious.&nbsp;</p><p>The quarantine further solidified this claim. The “Alejandro” crooner and Polansky spent the better part of the COVID-19 pandemic in each other’s company. Another source confirmed that Gaga enjoyed being cared for, and Polansky was there to do all that.</p><p>The insider shared that Michael “is very wealthy and liked to treat her to nice things and experiences.” The star singer would later confirm that she loved her man during an appearance on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-s-their-love-life-going><span class=ez-toc-section id=Hows_Their_Love_Life_Going></span>How’s Their Love Life Going?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Best believe, this sweet couple has had many public shows of affection, and one was during her birthday. Polansky sent flowers to Gaga on her birthday in March 2021.</p><p>This was while she was on the set of “House of Gucci,” and Gaga wasted no time showing off her sweet deed on Instagram. More of the lovers’ chummy moments have turned up on her Instagram page. This ranges from Valentine’s Day shout-out to just them being in their lover’s nest.</p><p>Michael is quite low-key, and this was Gaga’s approach at first. However, another insider told <a href=#>ET</a> that after the “American Horror Story” actress felt their intense connection, she was inspired to show off their romance.&nbsp;</p><p>This couple is going strong, and there has been evidence that Gaga and Polansky are not shy of being seen together in public. There have been sweet outings where she donned sundresses and grabbed coffee with the businessman.&nbsp;</p><p>Last year in November, the 35-year-old singer gushed to the Hollywood Reporter about the man in her life. Gaga did not hold back her feelings when she <a href=#>said</a>:</p><p>“My dogs and the man that I love are my whole life.”</p><p>Lady Gaga’s boyfriend has also proved to be more than a romantic partner. She once revealed that he <a href=#>partnered with her to help raise fund</a>s for those on the frontline during the pandemic.&nbsp;</p><p>She has also shared that Polansky was hands-on, as he worked with her mom and partner Maya Smith for their Born This Way Foundation.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>With the way things are going, fans might just be on the verge of witnessing a proposal in the near future. But, for now, Lady Gaga and Michael Polansky just want to revel in love.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kuqax02ajmpypYrSis8CsZJunqZu%2FqrHNnWSmoZOdrqa4jKmmpZmeqLi6ecKao6WdlGK6unnWoaalnV2htqexjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./matthew-morton.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Matthew Morton dating?
