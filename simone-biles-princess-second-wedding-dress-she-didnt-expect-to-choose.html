Like most brides, Simone had a clear idea in her mind about what style of wedding dress she wanted to wear on her big day, but she surprised herself by choosing the complete opposite.</p><p id=eYW7j8Q2BWZ data-wc=63>Simone was a radiant bride in a Galia Lahav princess-style gown, which featured a sheer corset bodice covered with applique flowers and a ballgown skirt with a thigh-split. Speaking of her dress, the petite gymnast told <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Vogue</a>: "I went with my gut feeling and what I felt the most beautiful in. I actually got a dress that I originally said I wouldn’t like."</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=eFO6NeLYhbv data-wc=56>She continued by explaining she was originally against the idea of choosing a tulle, A-line skirt as she didn't think it would suit her height and frame. "I was nervous about having a ball gown because I’m so petite – but it works perfect," she added, explaining that the other features helped balance out the skirt.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Carrie Hope Fletcher's colourful second wedding had its own fairground – exclusive photos" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/86e06bca631a-carrie-hope-fletcher-second-wedding.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Carrie Hope Fletcher's colourful second wedding had its own fairground – exclusive photos" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Carrie Hope Fletcher's colourful second wedding had its own fairground – exclusive photos</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="15 gorgeous celeb mother of the brides: Doria Ragland, Queen Camilla and more" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/92b9733b197d-celeb-mother-of-bride.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="15 gorgeous celeb mother of the brides: Doria Ragland, Queen Camilla and more" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>15 gorgeous celeb mother of the brides: Doria Ragland, Queen Camilla and more</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=egVm1-J2squ data-wc=18>"The leg slit was very crucial.
