Some dogs would launch an all-out attack before going anywhere near a leash, as canines do not always belong to us. However, that doesn’t mean they don’t continue to inspire us, and if you’re wondering <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">how your zodiac sign relates to wolves and wild dogs</a>, you’ve come to the right place.</p><p>Of all the animals on our planet, none seem to enchant us humans <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>more than canines</a>. You know as well as I do that nothing is more mesmerizing than the sound of a wolf howling in the night, as you can hear their voice echoing from miles away. And just before you know it, more wolves will join in on the chorus, resulting in an eerie moonlit melody that could ensnare your soul. It’s no wonder our ancestors decided to work together <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>with these pack animals</a>, eventually going so far as to domesticate them over thousands and thousands of years.</p><p>However, some dogs are <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>not meant to be tamed</a>. Some will always resist domestication, reserving their right to remain wild, primal, and forever free. And if you’re wondering which wolf or wild canine would still defend your zodiac sign against all odds, you no longer have to:</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=the-wolf-or-wild-dog-that-captures-each-zodiac-sign>The Wolf or Wild Dog That Captures Each Zodiac Sign</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Copy-of-List-Redirect-Design-6.png><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2><h2>Aries: You're the Northwestern Wolf</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1465841670.jpg><p>If Aries were a wolf, they would have to be the biggest and baddest wolf of them all. Let’s not forget Aries is ruled by Mars—planet of combat and war—making them the most fierce aggressor in the zodiac. And when it comes to the 40 subspecies of wolves, nothing comes close to the Northwestern wolf (aka timber wolf) in size and severity. This grizzly species is packing on extra pounds, more muscle, a stronger jaw, and even lungs with additional capacity. The result? A fierce predator that could destroy pretty much anything in its path. Aries wants to be number one and so does the timber wolf.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5><h2>Taurus: You're the Gray Fox</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1016608908.jpg><p>Taurus is one of the most regal and luxurious zodiac signs, meshing with the gray fox’s mythical association with prosperity and good fortune. After all, it’s incredible rare to see the North American gray fox, as they tend to be a more reclusive species that prefers to be left alone. Taurus can relate, as this species of fox is considered more aggressive than their more well-known counterpart—the red fox. They prefer to do hunting in private, as they are the only canine species known for climbing trees and leaping from branches to avoid being seen. This species is also famous for mating for life, matching the loyal temperament of a Venus-ruled Taurus.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3><h2>Gemini: You're the Red Fox</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-452372-001.jpg><p>If there’s one canine species that’s known for cleverness and intelligence, it would have to be the red fox. Gemini is a highly resourceful, adaptable, and sneaky air sign, which resembles their flexible and resilient spirit. After all, red foxes are known for living near human populations and surviving in urban areas. In fact, red foxes are one of the few non-domestic canines that are known to be friendly and nonthreatening to humans. Spiritually speaking, the red fox symbolizes bright and cunning energy that can help you solve impossible problems. The Gemini can relate.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1><h2>Cancer: You're the Gray Wolf</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-599379686.jpg><p>Cancer is a highly intuitive and nurturing water sign that gets their superpowers directly from the moon. And although it’s technically a myth that gray wolves howl at the moon, there’s no doubt their cries can be heard from miles away, especially at night. These wolves have been considered protectors across North American indigenous cultures since ancient times. The Quileute and Kwakiutl tribes have their origin stories centered on being directly descended from wolves. Cancer is a naturally nurturing and maternal zodiac sign, making this ancestral connection a powerful one.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4><h2>Leo: You're the Dingo</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-541051162.jpg><p>Of all the signs in the zodiac, Leo is most known for being warm, artistic, lively, and connected to the inner child. And since ancient times, the dingo has been revered by indigenous Australians since ancient times and considered the “creator” spirits of the animal world. Although the dingo is technically non-domestic, they’re known for being a friendlier species to humans. In fact, indigenous Australians would raise dingo pups from birth, taming and teaching them to protect the tribes, especially while they slept at night. You can even get a special permit to keep them as a pet in some parts of Australia.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4><h2>Virgo: You're the Fennec Fox</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-141249969.jpg><p>In astrology, Virgo is considered the zodiac sign of health, physical well-being, and survival. If any wild canine species can survive harsh climates and environments, it’s the clever—and adorable—fennec fox. Living in the Sahara Desert of North Africa, this species is famous for being able to go long periods without water and they gain nutrients from dieting on insects, rodents, and of course, cacti. Only a Virgo could be so resourceful in such an atmosphere, as their large ears also allow them to regulate their body temperature when other species would find themselves suffering from heat exhaustion.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3><h2>Libra: You're the Maned Wolf</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-520529502.jpg><p>Libra is always concerned with love, romance, and of course, aesthetics. Not only is the maned wolf essentially the supermodel of the canine world—seriously, look at those long legs and knee-high black boots—they’re also one of the few wolves that are actually monogamous. Instead of living in packs, they prefer to choose one mate and together, they will share and defend a ten-square-mile territory. Libra is considered the zodiac sign of one-on-one partnerships as well as protection and justice, making the maned wolf a perfect match for this cardinal air sign.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.5><h2>Scorpio: You're the Coyote</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1068213928.jpg><p>No zodiac sign is more strategic than a Scorpio, as this fixed water sign holds the cunning power of being able to trick and manipulate all those who stand in their way. The coyote—who is fearless enough to search for food in cities and urban areas—can mimic the sounds of up to seven or eight different animals in order to lure prey out into the open before their pack suddenly appears out of the woodwork and launches an attack. Talk about fooling your enemy! Like Scorpio, coyotes also symbolize death and rebirth, because you can only hear the sound of their howls during dusk and dawn, which are transitional times of day.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.5><h2>Sagittarius: You’re the African Wild Dog</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1267705075.jpg><p>Don’t be fooled by their polka-dotted fur and exotic appearance, because like Sagittarius, the African wild dog is much more formidable than they look. This canine species is one of the most effective hunters in the animal kingdom and they have an 80 percent success rate when it comes to securing their prey. In fact, this species is so clever that their pack can come together to fight bigger predators like lions and leopards. In astrology, Sagittarius is associated with the archer and they’re known for having exquisite aim when it comes to making their point or taking down their enemies.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4><h2>Capricorn: You're the Eurasian Wolf</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-674655141.jpg><p>Capricorn is the zodiac sign of discipline, tradition, and hierarchy, making them top dog. And like the Eurasian wolf, this zodiac sign receives its power from its long legacy of being both feared and worshipped. The Eurasian wolf has been the subject of lore and mythology since time immemorial, as they were worshipped as gods in ancient Greece and as dark entities by the ancient Norse. Apollo, the sun God, often took form as the Eurasian wolf, and this species is also associated with Fenrir, the wolf that killed Odin during Ragnarok.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.5><h2>Aquarius: You’re the Arctic Wolf</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-142247865.jpg><p>Ruled by stoic Saturn, Aquarius can be one of the most distant, mysterious, and unique zodiac signs. And like the Arctic wolf, they often prefer to live on the edge of the world, where others would find the conditions too cold to be tolerable. These wolves are also highly social and their psychological well-being depends on their intricately complex social structures. Because friendly Aquarius is always interested in something—or someone—new, this species is one of the few that is willing to approach humans with curiosity leading the way. However, they’re still predators, so that doesn’t mean you should try to pet them.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.5><h2>Pisces: You're the Jackal</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1130429070.jpg><p>Being the last sign in the zodiac, Pisces is known for being closest to the spirit world, reinforcing its association with magic and witchcraft. The jackal is one of the most storied and legendary canine species, as their status as nocturnal animals associates them with deep, underground knowledge. This species has been shrouded in mystery and spiritual associations since the beginning, as they are even mentioned several times in the Bible. However, they are also associated with deceptions and illusions, which matches the mystical and often misleading energy of Pisces. If a Pisces wants to cast a spell on you, they can and they will.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astrologynewslettersignup.png></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfr7yltcCcZKyhl6PAbsPOpZ1mr5mhsW6wzqBm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rashida-jones-acting-like-whores.html><span>←</span><span>Rashida Jones Tells Female Celebrities to 'Stop Acting Like Whores'</span></a>
