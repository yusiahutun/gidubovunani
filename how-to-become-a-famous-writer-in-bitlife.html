It’s challenging but gratifying. The same thing is true in BitLife. To become a famous writer, you need to work diligently to gain a worthwhile reputation in the game.</p><p data-injection=true>It takes a bit of time to get into this profession, and tracking it down in the menus can be a struggle, especially when you’re trying to break into fame. Here’s what you need to know about how to become a famous writer and author in BitLife.</p><h2>How to get a writer profession and become famous in BitLife</h2><p>To become a writer in BitLife, you must first graduate high school. Your character needs high Smarts, so you want to increase that as much as possible. There are multiple ways to do this, such as reading books through the tireless mini-game or visiting the library. We recommend reading books and then going to the library to avoid the mini-game when your character becomes old enough. Both activities are effective at keeping your character’s Smart stats up.</p><p data-injection=true><strong>Related</strong>: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">How to become a Librarian in BitLife</a></p><p>Once you graduate high school, you need to head to college and have your character work on getting their English degree. This should take you roughly four years to complete. After that, we recommend you attend a graduate school for higher learning focusing on English. This should not take as long, but keeping your Smarts stat up is important. After you’ve done that and graduate, the next step is to wait for a writer position to open up in the occupations. There’s quite a bit of luck when it comes to having this job appear, so if you’re patient, it should arrive. You should see (Publisher) next to it, too.</p><p data-injection=true>If you don’t see any jobs opening up with the (Publisher) name next to them, a good idea is to shut down the BitLife application and bring it back up again. When you launch the game, a new series of jobs under the Occupation page should appear, and hopefully, they’re the correct ones you’re looking for. You can continue doing this until the right job appears, preventing your character from aging too quickly.</p><p>When your character has a job, like any profession, you need to work hard on it every year and ensure your character maintains their high Smarts. While you’re working, we recommend keeping your Smarts stat high and continuing to read books to make it easier to keep the job and become proficient. After seven to ten years of being a writer and working hard, you should eventually become famous. The fame status will appear, and you’ll need to work on maintaining your notoriety by writing books every so often.</p><p>There’s a specific strategy for obtaining this job, but nothing is too complicated. Unfortunately, finding the Writer position under the occupation tab is probably the most significant complication, though you’ll also need a character with high Smarts stats when they initially start. Of course, you can always reroll your character to start over.</p><h3>About the author</h3><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/17c418c90324bdc0fbd0bc2ce42fdf32?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamepur.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2Fcropped-gamepur_favicon-1-192x192.png&r=g2x" height=96 width=96 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Zack Palm</h3><p class=author-url></p><p class=author-desc>Zack Palm is the Senior Writer of Gamepur and has spent over five years covering video games, and earned a Bachelor's degree in Economics from Oregon State University.
