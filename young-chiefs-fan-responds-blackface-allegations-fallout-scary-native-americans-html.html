Holden Armenta and his father, Bubba, were interviewed on Wednesday to respond to Deadspin reporter Carron J. Phillips' allegations that the nine-year-old was driving hate to both 'black people and Native Americans at the same time.'
Phillips, a Pulitzer nominee, initially shared a photo of the young boy with only half of his face painted in black before more pictures surfaced that showed Holden wearing half red and half black paint on his face, on social media."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
