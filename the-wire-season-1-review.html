Furthermore, The Wire tends to function more as social observation rather than social commentary.&nbsp; Simon and Burns refuse to provide answers or solutions because the story proves there's no quick fix when it comes to a complex web of conflicts, and, more importantly, to human nature.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The self-destructive nature of Homicide Detective Jimmy McNulty (<strong>Dominic West</strong>) begins our journey into the complicated world of Baltimore's cops and criminals.&nbsp; Westside drug kingpin Avon Barksdale (<strong>Wood Harris</strong>) has left a string of bodies as collateral damage in his criminal operation.&nbsp; After McNulty watches Avon's nephew D'Angelo (<strong>Larry Gilliard</strong>) escape conviction due to witness intimidation, he brings his grievances to Judge Phelan (<strong>Peter Gerety</strong>), and says that the murders will continue until Avon is brought to justice.&nbsp; Phelan uses his political might to push the Deputy Commissioner Ervin Burrell (<strong>Frankie Faison</strong>) to create a detail to investigate Barksdale.&nbsp; Burrell tells the detail's leader, Lieutenant Cedric Daniels (<strong>Lance Reddick</strong>), to keep the investigation brief and contained, but McNulty's constant needling and the mounting evidence against Barksdale expands the scope of the case.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/the-wire-season-1-tv-show-image-600x396.jpg><p>Most police dramas would focus simply on the work of the detail, and would barely acknowledge the criminal organization or the political factors guiding and obstructing the investigation.&nbsp; In The Wire, these elements are not only acknowledged, but deemed essential.&nbsp; Much like the cops, the criminals have a clear organizational structure but it's far more streamlined and functional than what the police (or "po-leece" in the dialect of both the cops and criminals) have.&nbsp; Avon is the top dog, Stringer Bell (<strong>Idris Elba</strong>) is his smart and steady second-in-command, and then there are lieutenants who function both as muscle and overseers of various parts of the drug-dealing locations.&nbsp; DeAngelo is demoted from the Towers to "The Pit", which makes less money and forces DeAngelo to function as both a boss and a mentor to the teenage dealers Poot Carr (<strong>Tray Chaney</strong>),Bodie Broadus (<strong>J.D. Williams</strong>), and Wallace (<strong>Michael B. Jordan</strong>).&nbsp; Of course, violence is also a strong factor in keeping the ranks in line.&nbsp; As Detective Thomas "Herc" Hauk (<strong>Domenick Lombardozzi</strong>) points out to his partner Ellis Carver (<strong>Seth Gilliam</strong>), the cops will never "win" because the criminals' system of promotion and punishment is far more powerful than what the Baltimore Police Department can dish out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Wire is a deeply complicated show and I could spend pages going through every plot development and character motive.&nbsp; But this isn't meant to be a recap.&nbsp; This is an outline of the organizations in play: The Law, The Politics, and The Criminals.&nbsp; Although the show's title is a literally a reference to the wiretapping the detail used to build their case against Barksdale, it's figuratively about the wires that interconnect and crossover the various aspects of the show.&nbsp; For example, the detail works with Omar Little (<strong>Michael K. Williams</strong>) in order to bring down Barksdale even though Omar is a criminal who participates not under pressure or threats, but because he wants revenge against Barksdale for the brutal retaliatory murder of Omar's partner and boyfriend.&nbsp; The detail also works with Bubbles (<strong>Andre Royo</strong>), a drug addict who volunteers as a criminal informant in order to punish Barksdale's crew for stomping on his friend.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/the-wire-season-1-tv-show-image-dominic-west-sonja-sohn-600x337.jpg><p>In a standard police procedural, there's no cooperation.&nbsp; There's only intimidation.&nbsp; The cops hang a charge over a criminal's head and the criminal either agrees to inform or they go to jail.&nbsp; In order to keep the plot moving forward, the criminal usually agrees to work with the cops.&nbsp; That kind of intimidation exists on The Wire, but it's used not only as a means of coercion, but also a means of unsanctioned punishment giving way to straight-up police brutality.&nbsp; When Detective Greggs (<strong>Sonja Sohn</strong>), a smart and honorable investigator on the detail, tries to get a hitter Barksdale's crew to cop to a murder and flip on his boss, the perp only throws hateful epithets her way.&nbsp; This behavior is greeted a severe beat-down by Greggs and two more cops inside the interrogation room.&nbsp; He deserves it, but we'd like to think cops are above such brutality.&nbsp; And in a normal cop show, such brutality would become the defining issue of an episode, and the cop would be punished.&nbsp; In The Wire, it's fairly commonplace, and so are other short-cuts.&nbsp; There are no straight-arrow po-lice on the show, and if there were, they'd be totally ineffective.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So are Greggs and her cohorts corrupt?&nbsp; Are they unfit for duty?&nbsp; Shouldn't they be above such behavior?&nbsp; The Wire doesn't quibble with these issues as plot points because the show isn't about moralizing.&nbsp; The show lives and breathes in the grey area, and it leaves the moral judgments to the viewer.&nbsp; That's not to say that a character's morality doesn’t affect their circumstances.&nbsp; If placed in a dramatic range, The Wire would absolutely be a tragedy.&nbsp; Some of the characters are doomed by their own personalities and moral code.&nbsp; McNulty's anti-authority streak, short temper, and self-righteousness mean he'll always hurt himself, and his resultant self-loathing will push away those around him.&nbsp; D'Angelo and Wallace show empathy in a game that has no patience for it, and both suffer and, in the case of Wallace, die as a result.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/the-wire-season-1-tv-show-image-idris-elba-600x337.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although empathy and righteousness are flaws in the world of The Wire, there are also traits that will push you ahead.&nbsp; For Simon and Burns, the most valuable aspects a person can have are intelligence and cunning, and the characters with these qualities are fan favorites.&nbsp; Detective Lester Freamon (<strong>Clarke Peters</strong>) is a quiet powerhouse who spends time making dollhouse furniture and being the smartest guy on the detail.&nbsp; On the criminal side, you have Stringer Bell, a man of steady demeanor and patience, and you have Omar, an outsider who is able to outsmart a deadly operation like Barksdale's.&nbsp; And to be a king in this world, to be Avon Barksdale or Baltimore politicians, you just have to mix in ruthlessness and selfishness.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>All of these aspects make The Wire a thoughtful, brainy experience that would be rewarding, but not necessarily entertaining.&nbsp; To draw the viewer into the rich themes, Simon and Burns walk a fine line between dramatic flourishes and deglamorizing their world.&nbsp; For the show's creators, the "action" scenes are the least interesting part of the mix.&nbsp; The raids always lack tension, and one of the season's biggest "action" moments—Greggs getting shot—happens off camera.&nbsp; The tension comes from the detail trying to find Greggs' vehicle.&nbsp; Getting the killer of Avon's ex-girlfriend isn't triumphant.&nbsp; What's triumphant is the scene where McNulty and his partner Bunk Moreland (<strong>Wendell Pierce</strong>) reconstruct the crime scene using only the word "Fuck."&nbsp; One of the season's most exciting scenes is when Freamon tells detail members Leander Sydnor (<strong>Corey Parker Robinson</strong>) and Roland "Prez" Pryzbylewski (<strong>Jim True-Frost</strong>) how to pull charter records. In The Wire, the drama is always from the chase, never from the capture.&nbsp; The first even sets up the specter of what could be cops' greatest chase and greatest futility: "Following the money," which would clearly lead to the dirty-as-hell State Senator R. Clayton "Clay" Davis (<strong>Isiah Whitlock Jr.</strong>).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/the-wire-season-1-tv-show-image-dominic-west-clarke-peters-600x337.jpg><p>However, this emphasis on chase-over-capture inevitably leads to an anti-climax, which serves the themes, but not the drama.&nbsp; It's a result of always putting realism first, and the reality of Baltimore as viewed through the lens of The Wire is futility.&nbsp; Avon's business goes on without him.&nbsp; The higher-ups in the Baltimore Police Department keep their standing.&nbsp; The detail ends, the team we've grown to love is broken up, McNulty is kicked out of homicide, Daniels loses his shot at being a major because he put the case ahead of his career, and Greggs is stuck recovering in a hospital.&nbsp; But Freamon gets pulled out of boring Pawn Shop division and reassigned to homicide, and the last shot of the season is a smiling Omar, sticking-up a drug dealer in the Bronx, and saying "It's all in the game."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the end of the first season of The Wire, the show manages to turn expectations on their head, and then laughs off the simple label of "police procedural."&nbsp;&nbsp; The Wire has been called literature in television form, and it's not an unfair description.&nbsp; Season One of The Wire brings us characters, backstories, dynamics, organizations, and a rich setting—all of the elements that make up a strong drama.&nbsp; It's also a show that can't be "skimmed" and even has long monologues.&nbsp; From the get-go, Simon and Burns proved they had made a show unlike any other, and I can't wait to see what Season Two has to offer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibn6G5qrDEq2Wcp51kwamxjLCgq51dqLKiv86nZGploprDqrHWaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-wire-season-1-review.html&text=THE%20WIRE%3a%20Season%201%20Review&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-wire-season-1-review.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-wire-season-1-review.html&title=THE%20WIRE%3a%20Season%201%20Review" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-wire-season-1-review.html&title=THE%20WIRE%3a%20Season%201%20Review" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-wire-season-1-review.html&title=THE%20WIRE%3a%20Season%201%20Review" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-wire-season-1-review.html&description=THE%20WIRE%3a%20Season%201%20Review" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./hundreds-of-school-officials-meet-to-discuss-piaa-playoff-system-rules.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Hundreds of school officials meet to discuss PIAA playoff system, rules">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./keith-powers-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Keith Powers Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
