And that’s true whether you’re someone who watched him and gained joy from seeing him on any of those shows, or someone who worked alongside him, sharing laughter and friendship. But when it comes to <strong>Richard Kline</strong>, who on Three’s Company played Jack Tripper’s best friend, Larry Dallas, he’s someone who could easily fall into both categories.</p><p>That becomes obvious when he’s asked what words come to mind when John’s name is brought up. “Oh, boy,” he says, apparently gearing up. “Friend, comedy genius, all around good guy, great father … there’s just too many things that come to mind.”</p><p>His voice doesn’t trail off for long, though, before he continues without prompting: “Baseball fan, <a href=#>Beatles</a> fan … huge Beatles fan. As a matter of fact, at his funeral the cabaret singer Amanda McBroom sang The Beatles song ‘In My Life.’ Not a dry seat in the house.”</p><p><strong>Please scroll down for much more of Richard’s memories.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46tn6udlah6pLvMqZinsV2owaK%2BjKOmoaZdp7a1wMSrZKudnZq6o7HRnptmmqliv6qvx5qpnWWbobavsY4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./no-heat-challenge.html><span>←</span><span>What It's Like to Stop Using Heat Tools for 30 Days</span></a>
