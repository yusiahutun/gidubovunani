It feels like things are fizzling out between them.”</p><p>They continued: “They have so much history together but we aren’t sure whether they will be able to save things this time.”</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Jason Momoa split from his wife on wedding anniversary – years before telling fans</a></p><p>The <a href=#>celebrity</a> has chosen to keep their romance a private matter, keeping her off his social media, but they are said to live in the <a href=#>Hollywood</a> hills with their dog, Geronimo. We do know they met at a restaurant ore than a decade ago after Bruno saw her and decided to introduce himself.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-has-bruno-said-about-jessica>What has Bruno said about Jessica?</h2><p>He hasn’t said much, but we do know she inspired one of his biggest songs, the ballad When I Was Your Man. The song is a sad piano ballad telling the story of a man having regrets and feeling guilty about the way he treated his girlfriend. The song came out just a year after they met, and Bruno said it’s about his own experiences. He said there ended up being a “happy ending” which could suggest it may be about his current flame.</p><p>He <a href=# rel=nofollow>said</a>: “This song is about a special woman that I let slip away at one time. It’s a happy ending, though … I put everything I got into that one. You know, it’s one of those things were even girls can relate to this song. That’s how it works.</p><p>“Everyone makes mistakes. And I remember writing that and it’s the simple things, the little things. Like, I should have bought you flowers; I should have just let you know when I had the chance.</p><p>“And that was probably the most difficult song to write just because you know I’m so naked on that song, out of all the sexual songs I’m singing about, that’s the one I’m most vulnerable. And I think a piano and a vocal is the most purest form of music.”</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>Celebrity couples who could break up in 2024 according to a psychic’s prediction</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2Z%2BcK7RrqWoZZ2Wv7R5wKebZqCZqHqotdGlnauhlaOxbrLAnJxmrKKkwqO4xGaYn6yVp3qttdWipaBlo5q9or7ArZxmpJmrsrR7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./adorable-moment-three-year-old-girl-plays-laptop-canada-video-html.html><span>←</span><span>Adorable moment three-year-old girl plays on a laptop in Canada [video]</span></a>
