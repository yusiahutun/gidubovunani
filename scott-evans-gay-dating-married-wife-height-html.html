But, he didn't reveal his sexuality, fearing it would hinder his career.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>However, it was accidentally revealed by his older brother, <a href=# rel=follow>Chris Evans</a>, the famous&nbsp;Captain America from the&nbsp;MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe).</p><p style=text-align:justify>During an interview with the Advocate, Chris accidentally <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">revealed</a> the truth about his brother. When asked about Scott's sexuality, he confirmed that his brother was gay. He affirmed:&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>Yes, I do have a gay brother. I’m down with the gays.

After realizing his mistake, Chris immediately asked if that affected Scott<span style=color:#000>&nbsp;in any way. But Scott was</span>&nbsp;happy that his brother was comfortable enough to talk about his sexuality.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Scott further added that he was at ease about the revelation and didn’t blame Chris for the news. He even quoted: <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p style=text-align:justify>"Dude, I don’t care. It’s as if you said Scott Evans has blonde hair and blue eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s who I am,&nbsp;I don’t really&nbsp;care."</p><p style=text-align:justify>After the incident, Scott helped Chris learn about the struggles gay people faced&nbsp;in their day-to-day life. The Evans&nbsp;brothers are now strong advocates of gay rights, and Scott openly talks about his sexuality through social media.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Gay Actor:-&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=follow>Zeljko Ivanek Married, Gay, partner, Family, Net Worth</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2 style=text-align:justify>Does Scott Evans Have A Wife?
