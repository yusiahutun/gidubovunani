Morgan Wallen first gained national attention after appearing on the singing competition show "The Voice" in 2014. While he did not win the competition, he did subsequently land a record contract and was able to use the platform to launch his career as a country artist. He released his debut album "If I Know Me" in 2018, which featured the hit singles "Up Down" and "Whiskey Glasses." A second album followed in 2021, cementing Wallen's position as one of the most promising new country stars.</p><p>In addition to his successful debut album, Wallen has released several chart-topping singles, including "Chasin' You," "More Than My Hometown," and "7 Summers." His unique style and powerful vocals have earned him a loyal fan base and critical acclaim within the country music community.</p><p>Morgan's rise to fame has not been without controversy. One notable legal issue occurred in 2020, when he was arrested at a bar for disorderly conduct. Wallen has also faced widespread criticism for not wearing a mask at a party during the Covid-19 pandemic – especially since he was photographed kissing multiple women. This controversy led to his performance on "Saturday Night Live" being postponed. Things became even worse when he was caught uttering the N-word in public. In 2021, Wallen was dropped from his record label as a result of this error. In addition, some radio networks stopped playing his music and he was disqualified from the Academy of Country Music Awards.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Morgan Cole Wallen was born on May 13th of 1993 in Sneedville, Tennessee. Raised in a Baptist family, Morgan's father was a pastor. Wallen started his journey into music very early, and his parents arranged piano and violin lessons while he was still very young. Initially, Morgan displayed considerable potential as an athlete. His performances for his high school basketball team were so impressive that he was even offered a scholarship. However, a career-ending injury saw him switch gears and focus on music instead.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Morgan Wallen's career began when he competed on "The Voice." Although he was eliminated during the playoffs, Morgan would soon return to the world stage. During his time on the show, Wallen made a few valuable connections and was able to sign a record deal. He then released an EP called "Stand Alone" before signing a new record deal with Big Loud Records.</p><p>In 2016, he began work on a debut studio album. Singles like "The Way I Talk," "You Make It Easy," and "Up Down" were released over the next two years, and in 2018 Morgan finally released the album "If I Know Me." One of the most successful tracks from this album was "Whiskey Glasses," which topped the country charts.</p><p>His next album was released in 2020, and it was entitled "Dangerous: The Double Album." This entry was even more successful than his first, and it featured tracks like "More than My Hometown" and "7 Summers." Even though his racial slur controversy put a dent in his momentum, Wallen continued to be incredibly popular. In fact, data shows that both physical and digital album sales increased by up to 100% after the controversy emerged.</p><p>In 2023, Wallen released his third studio album, "One Thing at a Time." The album topped the Billboard 200 with all of its 36 tracks entering the Billboard 100, breaking the record for most songs by an artist on the chart at once. The single "Last Night" became Wallen's first to top the Hot 100. A 12-week concurrent run atop the charts for the album broke several records, including a 31-year one set by <a href=# title="Billy Ray Cyrus Net Worth">Billy Ray Cyrus</a>.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-316260 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Morgan-Wallen2.jpg alt="Morgan Wallen Net Worth" width=594 height=396 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-316260 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Mike Coppola/Getty Images)</p><h2 id=controversy><strong>Controversy</strong></h2><p>In 2020, Morgan experienced his first major controversy when he was arrested outside of <a href=# title="Kid Rock Net Worth">Kid Rock</a>'s bar in Nashville. Wallen was heavily intoxicated, and he was charged with disorderly conduct. After this incident, Wallen publicly apologized to his fans on social media. Despite the fact that he obviously regretted his actions, Wallen suffered another controversial moment later in 2020.</p><p>Footage emerged that showed Morgan partying at a bar in Alabama. That alone wouldn't have been controversial, but Wallen was not wearing a mask or respecting social distancing guidelines. He was even kissing female multiple college students. The fact that he had violated Covid-19 protocols made "Saturday Night Live" cancel his scheduled performance that year. However, Wallen later appeared in a sketch on the show, parodying the incident.</p><p>With that controversy seemingly dealt with, Morgan didn't wait long before making an even more shocking error. In late January, a clip emerged that clearly showed Wallen using the N-word with friends. Immediately, Morgan issued a number of apologies for his actions. It wasn't enough. A wide range of radio networks removed Wallen's music from the air, and his record label contract was suspended indefinitely. In addition, his latest album became ineligible for multiple country music awards. Wallen apologized on social media once again, and this time he urged his fans not to defend him.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Wallen and his ex-girlfriend, KT Smith, had one son together who was born in July 2020. As of mid 2023 it's been rumored that Morgan is dating Megan Moroney.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR70qKloJ2iqHyuu9GgmKdlp5a5rbHNZqWerF2svLPAx2g%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmorgan-wallen-net-worth.html&text=Morgan%20Wallen%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmorgan-wallen-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmorgan-wallen-net-worth.html&title=Morgan%20Wallen%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmorgan-wallen-net-worth.html&title=Morgan%20Wallen%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmorgan-wallen-net-worth.html&title=Morgan%20Wallen%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmorgan-wallen-net-worth.html&description=Morgan%20Wallen%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./dexter-new-blood-cast-character-guide.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="New Blood Cast and Character Guide">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./how-to-add-friends-on-discord.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How to Add Friends on Discord">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
