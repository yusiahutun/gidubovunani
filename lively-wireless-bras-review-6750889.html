I was not part of this complaint fest, as being a 38DD, going without a bra is an uncomfortable, back pain-inducing, and sweaty hell. However, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>being in a regular bra</a> for 16+ hours is not fun either. So I found an in between option: wireless bras.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For the last few years, I’ve tried every wireless bra I’ve come into contact with, which amounts to dozens at this point. There is only one brand that I come back to for repeated wear: <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Lively</a>. It’s even passed my personally devised stairs test.</p><p>First, I’ll explain my trial methods. I live at the top of a six-floor walk-up building, so now, for one of these bras to pass my test, I have to be able to make it down to the lobby to check my mail and back upstairs without having to adjust. I have been bamboozled by wireless bras before; I’ll hang around at home, thinking they are supportive enough, only to wear them out and have my boobs literally falling out of the cups while walking and moving about — much to my horror. Lively’s the Spacer Bra and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">All-Day Deep-V No-Wire Bra</a> both passed this test with flying colors.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-spacer-bra></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Spacer Bra</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Lively</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now:</strong> $45; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">wearlively.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I have raved about this bra before, but it bears repeating. I didn’t know a wireless bra could be so comfortable, supportive, and shapely enough to wear out of the house. It holds my boobs in place and keeps them separate from each other — one of my biggest priorities since I am prone to sweat and breakouts if they’re touching.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It comes in sizes 32A to 38DD and five colors, including classic options like black and almond. This is a great bra to wear around the house or under sweaters and loose T-shirts.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-all-day-deep-v-no-wire-bra></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>All-Day Deep-V No-Wire Bra</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Lively</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now</strong>: $45; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">wearlively.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">The All-Day Bra</a> surprised me. I was expecting the deep-V style to be too free for my heaving bosom — I thought my boobs would fall out as soon as I even so much as breathed. But, like I said, it passed my stairs test. It comes in three colors and feels a little sexier than the Spacer Bra, giving me a little bit of cleavage, so it’s a great option for low-cut tees or semi-sheer tops. The straps can also be worn straight down or in a racerback style — the latter is great for when I need to tighten things up to ensure everything stays in place.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As a 39DD, I can’t believe I’ve found one, let alone two, wireless bras that I actually like wearing. Right now is a good time to snag my two favorite bras thanks to a bundle deal where you can get two products for $50 — essentially a two-for-one offer, given the bras’ $45 price tag. Head to Lively to shop <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">the Spacer</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">All-Day</a> wireless bras, or the brand’s <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">other similarly comfortable styles</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57y6KtnqSpYsSqvsSlnKyrXZe%2For%2BMq5yvoZWseneDlGlvcXE%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./12-magical-ways-to-decorate-with-feathers.html><span>←</span><span>12 Magical Ways to Decorate With Feathers</span></a>
