Maybe, but it also could sum up the slaughter that engulfed the South Korean island of Jeju, which is less than 100 kilometres south of the Korean peninsula, from April 1948 through the Korean war that ended five years later. Official estimates place the number of people killed between 25,000 and 30,000, somewhat less than the 32,000 estimated to have died so far in Gaza.The parallels between the killings on Jeju and those in Gaza might have struck the several thousand people gathered at the Peace Park on Jeju for a ceremony marking the 76th anniversary of sa sam, or “four three”. That is in reference to April 3, 1948, the day of the outbreak of the campaign to wipe out those <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">opposed to the government</span></a> in Seoul.As in the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Israeli war against Hamas</span></a>, Korean authorities at the time cited the rebels’ attacks against police and soldiers. It was not until 2003 that South Korea’s president, the late Roh Moo-hyun, apologised for what took place. April 3 is now a day of mourning.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Just who was in charge in Seoul at the time of the outbreak of the slaughter in 1948 was not clear in the aftermath of US forces assuming control over the Korean peninsula south of the 38th parallel after the Japanese surrender on August 15, 1945. However, there is no doubt who is in charge in Israel, and there is no question that the Israeli authorities are in command of the Israeli Defence Forces’ attacks against Hamas.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2024/04/03/clean_1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">03:26</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Humanitarian aid workers delivering food killed in Gaza in 'unintentional' air strike</p><p>Humanitarian aid workers delivering food killed in Gaza in 'unintentional' air strike</p>The common denominator between the events in Jeju and Gaza is US arms.

Just as in Israel’s war, the police and military in Jeju used US weapons, first under the overall authority of the US occupation command in Seoul and then under the first South Korean President <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Syngman Rhee</span></a>, who proved far more willing than the Americans had ever been to kill indiscriminately.The Israeli military is killing much faster, and in much greater numbers, than the South Korean forces did on Jeju. While the Israeli government might not have deliberately ordered any attacks on civilians in Gaza, they must have known that an <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">attack on a hospital</span></a> Israel suspected of harbouring Hamas fighters would end up killing far more civilians than enemy combatants.It might be possible to believe that any able-bodied man in the line of fire could be a terrorist, but no one can offer such a rationale for the deaths of women and children. Defenders of Israel might argue that <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">collateral deaths</span></a> are simply a fact of life in any war, as well as that some of the deaths taking place in Gaza are simply because of the kind of tragic errors that you have to expect during a conflict. <img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/10/19/CLEAN-THUMB.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">05:14</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Hundreds killed in Gaza hospital blast, Israel and Hamas trade blame</p><p>Hundreds killed in Gaza hospital blast, Israel and Hamas trade blame</p>One large difference between the slaughter in Jeju and the one <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">taking place in Gaza</span></a> is the US response. There is no sign that the authorities in Washington, then under the Harry Truman administration, were aware of what was happening on Jeju, much less concerned about it.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In response to a request for comment, the US State Department said earlier this month that “the Jeju incident of 1948 was a terrible tragedy, and we should never forget the devastating loss of life”. It was the first the US government stated an official position on the issue, but it did not apologise.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">What military support does the US provide to Israel?</span></p></a></h3>The US response is essentially “innocent until proven guilty”, but of what? There is no evidence of any US role other than that of command responsibility as the ruling power for the first three years after the Japanese surrender. Just as the <a rel=nofollow class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Korean war</span></a> is often called the “forgotten war”, so the Jeju slaughter is forgotten.Of course, Israel is another story. US President Joe Biden <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">has repeatedly urged</span></a> Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to refrain from more attacks which are sure to kill more Palestinian citizens than Hamas fighters. Given the Biden administration’s hesitance to pull back the enormous amount of aid the US supplies to Israel, such pleas might come across as insincere. With Biden running for re-election this year, he is trying to sound like a peacemaker while still offering support to Israel.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The ambivalence in the US response to Gaza has echoes of its response to the killings on Jeju. It is true that US forces in South Korea did not order or condone what happened to the people of Jeju. They just failed to get Rhee’s forces to stop it.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The same might be said of the US role in Gaza. Judging from everything he has said so far, Biden appears to be doing all he can to rein in Netanyahu and the Israeli military, but some might say that’s all for show. Just as in Jeju more than seven decades ago as in Gaza now, the sin of omission is tantamount to that of commission.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Donald Kirk is an author and journalist from Washington, DC.
