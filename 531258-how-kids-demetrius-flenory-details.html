Does he have a family to come to? Does Demetrius Flenory have a son?</p><h2>How many kids does Demetrius Flenory have?</h2><p class=align-left>Demetrius Flenory has only <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">one known child</a>, Demetrius Flenory Jr, or Lil Meech, as he is known. Lil Meech was born on April 22, 2000, and is 23 years old as of 2023. He is an actor and <a href=#>rapper</a>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/65fd5f1b4f26c2cf.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Sultana, Oppenheimer: 7 Top Trending Movies in Kenya 2023</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Lil Meech was born in Miami, Florida, numerous years after his father's illegal business was established in Southwest Detroit. Considering Big Meech was incarcerated in 2005, Lil Meech didn’t get to spend much time with his father when he was young and was raised by his mother.</p><p class=align-left>Demetrius Flenory Jr established his <a href=#>career as a rapper</a> after the release of his debut song in 2019. The song, titled <i>Bad Habits,</i> was self-released by Lil Meech and features a brief recording of his father conversing in prison.</p><p class=align-left>On top of this, Lil Meech has established himself in the acting industry and showed his expertise in 50 Cent’s BMF <a href=#>series</a> adaptation. Lil Meech has also appeared in HBO’s <i>Euphoria </i>and done a small project on the small screen as Syl in <i>Taurus</i> (2022).</p><h2>Who is Big Meech's daughter?</h2><p class=align-left>Are you wondering about Big Meech's daughter in BMF? Numerous people were not aware that Big Meech had a daughter until 2019. The incarcerated drug lord’s mother shared an<a href=#> image on Instagram </a>commemorating Manessa’s birthday.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/993de1ea2a84a04c.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Terence Creative Steps out As Papa Fred to Receive His Idol Koffi Olomide: "I'm Big Fan"</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The post indicates that Manessa was born on July 2, but there isn't more information about the birth year. However, it is yet to be substantially confirmed that Big Meech had a daughter, as it is only deduced from this information.</p><h2>Are there other Demetrius Flenory Sr kids?</h2><p class=align-left>Considering the secretive nature of people in illegal business, it is hard to know if Demetrius had other children. And it is only now that the media is shining some light on his matters about his family getting into the limelight.</p><p class=align-left>People started speculating about other children after they got wind of Manessa. Another person who people claim is Demetrius’ child is Demetria Edwadior Jackson Flenory. She stated that she is Big Meech’s daughter; however, the claims are yet to be confirmed. Other individuals who claim to be the incarcerated trafficker’s children are Queen Turdy and Neeka.</p><h2>How is the relationship between Big Meech and his children?</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b01782273ad1850b.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Phillip Schofield's relationship with Matthew McGreevy explained</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The renowned gangster is still in prison and is set for release in 2028. Hence, he has yet to have that much interaction with his children. Since he is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">behind bars</a>, he isn't free to contact the rest of the <a href=#>world</a>, which means he has not had an <a href=#>ordinary relationship</a> with his children. Things may change after he is released from prison.</p><p class=align-left>Lil Meech was five years old when his father was convicted to 30 years in federal prison. Interestingly, he kept in touch with his father and constantly communicated with him during the BMF TV series production stage.</p><h2>Wrapping up</h2><p class=align-left>There is no doubt that Big Meech’s name will be spoken in hush tones for decades, considering his infamy. His children, with the most popular one, Demetrius Flenory Jr., still hold his name and, in a way, keep his legacy alive, although it is negative.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/115030c31c495ec1.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Meet Benjamin Travolta, actor John Travolta's look-alike son</span></p></a><p class=align-left>But people still cannot believe Big Meech had only one child and keep asking, “How many kids does Demetrius Flenory have?” And the most exciting thing is that many more people claim to be Big Meech’s children. However, they are yet to be confirmed as part of the family.</p><p class=align-left>Are you searching for more information about Erica Mena’s children?
