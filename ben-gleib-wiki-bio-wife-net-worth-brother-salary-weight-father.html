Awakenings made me cry in the theater. Something only two or three movies have ever done. And Big and A League of Their Own were both such heartfelt and hilarious movies. Humanity just exuded from her films. But she was also so humble. I met her once, and told her I loved this story she told on Bob Costas’ old show one night. He asked why she decided in the last scene of Big, when he goes back to being a kid while walking down the street, to go with the simple cinematic style of cutting from him as Tom Hanks, then just back to him as a kid in a big suit. She replied in her heavy New York accent, “People always say how they liked that scene, how I chose not to use any special effects, but the truth is I don’t know how to do any of that fancy stuff. Special effects and all that nonsense. So all I knew how to do was to show him still big, then cut back and now he’s small again, with a huge oversized suit on.” She smiled when I told her that, and said to me “Oh yeah, I just don’t know how to do any of that stuff.” Yet she still made some of the greatest films ever. I guess simplicity, and humility can lead to greatness. She will be missed. #RIP</a></p><p>A post shared by <a href=#>Ben Gleib</a> (@bengleib) on Dec 19, 2018 at 2:34am PST</p><h3><span id=Ben_Gleiberman8217s_Job_Net_Worth>Ben Gleiberman’s Job Net Worth</span></h3><p>Ben was introducing humor clubs.
