The song "Invisible" by 5 Seconds of Summer delves into the feelings of invisibility and isolation that many individuals experience at some point in their lives. It captures the essence of being present physically, yet feeling completely unseen and unheard. The lyrics paint a picture of a person who is not just overlooked by others, but also struggles to define their own identity. Throughout the song, several standout lyrics contribute to the development of various themes, all of which tie back to the overarching theme of invisibility and self-discovery.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Opinion | Quality journalism to benefit from Hong Kong shelving law against fake news</h2><time>Sep 7, 2024</time>

The government has finally shelved a law against fake news first proposed in 2021 in the wake of social unrest and amid the battle against the Covid-19 pandemic. The decision is welcome.

The sight of Captain Ross’s toned torso made compulsive Sunday viewing for female fans of Poldark.
Unfortunately for them, actor Aidan Turner has decided to keep his rippling six-pack under wraps for the third series.
The good news, however, is that there are three other male characters who are planning to mimic the likes of Turner’s head-turning scything scene when the show returns to the BBC next month.
