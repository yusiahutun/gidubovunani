Cooking salmon is fairly easy. Because it's such a rich, fatty fish, it stays moist, even if slightly overcooked. If possible, buy wild salmon, which, although more expensive than the farmed fish, has a firmer texture.
This is my version of a dish I tasted at the Maison Kammerzell restaurant in Strasbourg, France.

Contrary to earlier reports that claimed he suffered from a heart attack, Alan’s confirmed cause of death is “a ruptured aorta,” and a “standard type A aortic dissection,” according to the death certificate obtained by Entertainment Tonight.

George Strait's 1996 album 'Blue Clear Sky' spawned many hit singles, including his 30th No. 1 song, 'Carried Away.' The tune was penned by hit songwriters Steve Bogard and Jeff Stevens who decided to write a song with lyrics that would hit home to mostly everyone who heard the beautiful ballad.
"'Carried Away' was a title inspired almost as an apology for being 'too far gone' about someone," Bogard tells Taste of Country.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../../categories/blog/page/99/>← Prev Page</a>
