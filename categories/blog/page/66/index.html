The winger, 33, revealed how his life spiralled out of control in September when Bradford Bulls sacked him.
The Super League club had handed Raynor a contract after he had served seven months of a 15-month prison sentence for a £36,500 internet scam.
But, after playing 20 games this year, they threw him out ­after discovering he was hooked on sleeping pills.
Raynor said that, on top of worries about paying back £120,000 debts as a result of a fake printer ink business, took him to the edge of despair.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Old Dominion Plot 2020 U.S. We Are Old Dominion Tour Dates</h2><time>Jun 11, 2024</time>

The reality TV series started with the entire family, including Willie Edwards’s dad, mother, and brother, among other relatives. But as we speak, Willie is his clan’s last man standing on the show.
The TV star has endured a lot, not just through his alligator hunting escapades but also in his personal life.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Hawkeyes ziplining, cooking &amp;amp; bonding in Italy</h2><time>Jun 10, 2024</time>

It is a really simple thing that gives a lot of pleasure to those of us crazy about movies. Film or movie quotes might be that one line dialog or two in an entire movie. &nbsp;But, just like a good scene, a memorable one-liner in a movie stays on.
