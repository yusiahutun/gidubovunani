"And so, if it’s just me by myself, okay, cool. But I find that the energy that other people have is the greatest – other people are like hotspots for me. I write differently when an artist is trying to express something, or there’s something I think they should be expressing. That's what we call inspiration. Inspiration is a vibe… That's the job. I'm loyal to that."
如果我只是單獨創作，那可能很酷。但我發現其他人能啟發我的能量是最大的，其他人對我來說就像熱點。當某個藝術家試圖表達某種東西，或者我認為他們應該表達某種東西時，我寫的東西就不一樣。這就是我們所謂的靈感。靈感是一種氛圍...這是我應該做的事，我對此忠誠。
