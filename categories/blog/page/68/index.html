Prince Harry will be visiting the UK in May, to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the Invictus Games. It’s unclear whether Meghan Markle will be by her husband’s side yet, but one expert claims Harry ‘won’t bring his children’ without his wife by his side.

Words have no power to impress the mind without the exquisite horror of their reality.
In Edgar Allan Poe's quote, he posits that words possess limited ability to impact the human mind unless they evoke a sense of chilling reality. This statement captures the essence of Poe's writing style, known for its macabre tales and dark themes. By infusing his words with a vivid and horrifying reality, Poe aimed to leave a lasting impression on his readers.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Gildas Club and Us TOO host prostate cancer support group WHBF OurQuadCities.com</h2><time>Jun 7, 2024</time>

Winter dressing can get quite formulaic. When the first priority is warmth, followed by style, most of us fall into a similar routine: Jeans (with no holes), a sweater, jacket, and boots — it’s the season’s no-nonsense outfit recipe. But as simple as day-to-day dressing can be, I honestly become quite flummoxed when dressing up in winter; everything’s either too bare to wear in cold temperatures or too frumpy. Fortunately, Gwyneth Paltrow just reminded me that there’s an elevated version of one of my favorite cozy ‘fits.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Mamie Van Doren Tells All About Romances With Frank Sinatra, Clark Gable, Johnny Carson, Elvis and M</h2><time>Jun 7, 2024</time>

As was recently related to Closer Weekly&nbsp;by&nbsp;The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel&nbsp;star Alex Bornstein, Season 2 of the Amazon streaming series is about change. That’s certainly what Michael Zegen is hoping for when it comes to his character of Joel Maisel, who turned the life of his wife, Midge Maisel, upside down in the first season premiere (inadvertently sending the Rachel Brosnahan-played character down the path of stand-up comedy).
