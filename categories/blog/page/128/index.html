It stands as one of the most expensive maritime losses in history.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Royal children at Balmoral: 10 sweetest photos of Prince William, King Charles, Queen Elizabeth &amp;amp; Co</h2><time>Mar 2, 2024</time>

Racist, sexist, homophobic, a shameless drunk vulgarian who dribbled spit, told toilet jokes and ogled women, Sir Les Patterson was Barry Humphries' favourite character.
Representing the worst of Australian males of the 1970s, wrapped up into one outrageous but often hilarious package, Sir Les was an anachronism almost from the moment he lurched on stage - and one that would never have survived today.
