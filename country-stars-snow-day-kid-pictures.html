Combs and his wife both shared video footage of him walking outside their house hand-in-hand with their oldest son, Tex. Tex is just a year-and-a-half old, meaning that it was very likely the first time he's ever seen this much snow.</p><p>"We got this, dawg. Big steps," Combs can be heard saying, as he holds Tex's hand and their dog JoJo runs wildly through the snow around them.</p><p>"Whoa!" Tex can be heard saying in another part of the clip.</p><figure class="img-tag has-sizer aligncenter"><p><span class=visually-hidden>Instagram</span></p>Instagram<p>loading...</p></figure><figure class="img-tag has-sizer aligncenter"><p>attachment-Luke2</p><p>loading...</p></figure><p>JoJo wasn't the only dog to make an appearance during country stars' snow days:&nbsp;<a href=#>Chris Young</a> got a video of his German Shepherd, Porter, frolicking in the snow, while <a href=#>Kelsea Ballerini</a>'s pup Dibs seemed less than thrilled to be sitting out in the cold — despite the fact that he was wearing a dog jacket.</p><p>From the looks of it, <a href=#>Carly Pearce</a>'s shih tzu pups didn't even venture outside at all: She shared a snapshot of one of her dogs cozied up indoors in a blanket.</p><p>Some country stars have babies too young to truly play in the snow, like <a href=#>Maddie & Tae</a>'s Maddie Font, whose son Forrest was <a href=#>born in mid-September.</a> She snapped a photo of her husband Jonah holding Forrest near a window, the father-and-son pair gazing out at the snow together.</p><p>Meanwhile, some of country music's young families — especially those with kids toddler-aged and up — had a more rambunctious experience. Kane Brown took his daughter Kingsley sledding, and she had fun, despite getting a face-full of snow as they cruised down the hill.</p><p>"Oh, it's all in her face. Are you okay?" said mom Katelyn Brown with a laugh from behind the camera.</p><p>"Yeah, it's so cold I can't see," Kingsley replies.</p><figure class="img-tag has-sizer aligncenter"><p><span class=visually-hidden>Instagram</span></p>Instagram<p>loading...</p></figure><p><a href=#>Jana Kramer</a>'s kids went sledding, too, while <a href=#>Jason Aldean</a>'s two young children enjoyed another classic snow day activity: A snowball fight!</p><p>Some of the stars stayed behind the camera and out of the snow while their kids played, but others ventured outside with their families.</p><p>Hot Dad Alert: <a href=#>Sam Hunt</a> was composed and effortlessly stylish as he posed in the snowfall with his toddler daughter, Lucy.</p><p>Flip through the gallery below to see those country stars and more enjoying their rare Nashville snow day.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>Snow Day! See Photos of Country Stars + Their Kiddos Playing in the Snow</h2><p>Monday (Jan. 15) was an unusually wintry day in Nashville, with several inches piling up. Snow like this doesn't come around Middle Tennessee often, so of course country stars, their kids and even their pets had to get out and play!</p><p class=photogallery-credit>Gallery Credit: Carena Liptak</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmnKelo8GzxYysq5qqo2LAr7vWZpuasV2gtqV5z6Kara2imsBw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./beyonces-blue-ivy-glam-evening-looks-jay-z-gala.html><span>←</span><span>See Beyonc and Blue Ivy Carter Wear Glamorous Evening Looks to Celebrate Jay-Z</span></a>
