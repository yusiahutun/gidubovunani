The Super League club had handed Raynor a contract after he had served seven months of a 15-month prison sentence for a £36,500 internet scam.
But, after playing 20 games this year, they threw him out ­after discovering he was hooked on sleeping pills.
Raynor said that, on top of worries about paying back £120,000 debts as a result of a fake printer ink business, took him to the edge of despair."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

I don’t hold any grudges against them because it was my own fault.”</p><p>Catriona appealed to the RFL for help and the couple called in the Sporting Chance clinic.</p><p>Raynor said: “The RFL were brilliant. They obviously didn’t want another situation like the one where Terry Newton killed himself.</p><p>“Every day for a month, a guy from Sporting Chance visited me and helped me so much that it was decided I didn’t need to be admitted to their clinic.</p><p>“For the next month, he visited me four days a week and now we’re down to one day and I’m doing really well.”</p><p>Raynor admits he used to ­bottle up his problems but is speaking out, in the week that Gary Speed killed himself, in the hope that it will help ­others.</p><p>Thefather-of-twoadded: “Sometimesnegativescan have a positive effect on other people, by showing that help is out there.</p><p>“I’m now off all the tablets, haven’t touched a drop of drink since September and I’m ­training hard again and hoping to get back playing.”</p><p>Raynor admits he has little chance of signing for a Super League club again.</p><p>He said: “The thing I’d love to do is play for Featherstone in the Championship. I grew up supporting them.</p><p>“This is not out of desperation because I really don’t think I’ve anything to prove. But after the last few dramatic years I’ve had I’d just like to get back to the ­enjoyment of playing.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKugpL%2B1e9GunpuxXaGyorPUnmagmaKawal50Zqwp6eiYrpursCcomadlJyybn2Xa25ubWNn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./clear-channel-communications-now-iheartmedia-founder-lowry-mays-dead-at-87.html><span>←</span><span>Clear Channel Communications (Now iHeartMedia) Founder Lowry Mays Dead at 87</span></a>
