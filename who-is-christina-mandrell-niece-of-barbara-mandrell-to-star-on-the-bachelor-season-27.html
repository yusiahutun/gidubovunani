On January 23, 2023, Bachelor Nation will be reunited with a brand new cast of hopeful romantics, all vying for the chance to find true love with the show's newest leading man, Zach Shallcross. Zach is no stranger to Bachelor Nation, having previously appeared as a contestant on Gabby Windey and Rachel Recchia's season of 'The Bachelorette'.</p><p>In the newest season of 'The Bachelor,' Zach will be spotted romancing 30 women, all dedicated to winning over this tech executive's heart. Zach is getting ready to meet his future love on <a href=# rel>'The Bachelor' Season 27</a>, and Christina Mandrell is one of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">lucky five ladies</a> he's already had the chance to meet! It's safe to say that the two hit it off right away as Christina memorably brought two mini liquor bottles for the pair to enjoy during their initial meeting. Now, viewers have the chance to get to know the model even better as they prepare for the season premiere. But, before ABC airs the highly anticipated premiere, let's take the opportunity to learn a bit more about Christina.</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>'The Bachelorette' on ABC: Who is Zach Shallcross?

'The Bachelorette' fans see through plan</a></p><h2 class=split>Who is Christina Mandrell?</h2><p>Christina Mandrell, a 26-year-old content creator based in Nashville, Tennessee, is a single mother to her daughter Blakely. Despite juggling motherhood alone, she does an incredible job of co-parenting with her ex, Blake Dennis, whom she married in 2015. Christina's commitment to her daughter is reflected in her Bachelor bio where she stresses that her ideal man would have to be ready to take on the role of a step-parent.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">ScreenRant</a>, she has also been featured in several music videos, including Cole Swindell's 'She Had Me At Heads Carolina', Taylor Swift's 'Fifteen', and Kevin Quinn's 'It's About Time'. Christina has also appeared in films and television shows, including 'Becoming Jesse Tate', 'Hannah Montana: The Movie', 'A Belle for Christmas', and 'After Darkness'. Apart from featuring in movies and music videos, she has even collaborated with companies like Amazing Lace and Pink Lily.</p><p>Christina is surely no stranger to the spotlight. She comes from a family of performers with her famous aunt, the legendary country music singer Barbara Mandrell, and her mom, Irlene Mandrell, who, along with their sister Louise, formed the Mandrell Sisters and had their own TV show. Though Christina has taken a different route than her family and became a model instead of a country music star, she still knows how to shine.</p><p>Christina's Instagram bursts with fun-filled photos and reels, and her content is usually comical and light. Her bio reads, "What do I do? ... my best, I'm doing my best [shrugging emoji]". Her link tree is full of links to her favorite items with discount codes. But, social media isn't always a joyride for the content creator. Recently, as per <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Showbiz CheatSheet</a>, 'The Bachelor' star faced heavy social media trolling from the show's fans for being an "absent mother." The trolling exceeded to a level that a supervisor at Pink Lily had to intervene to support Christina.</p><p>Catch Christina on 'The Bachelor' Season 27, premiering on January 23 at 8 pm ET on ABC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRor5ikeqq%2FjJyfq6GjqbavrYymmKecopq5rXnNopycnV2ks26uwKuZmqqRYrqiusOrnKWkXam8br%2FTmqlmp55iwamxjJuYnKCVobyzedKemKynnmJ%2FeA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./taylor-swift-makes-surprise-performance-country-group-little-big-town-pittsburgh-stop-1989-world-tour-html.html><span>←</span><span>Taylor Swift with Little Big Town during Pittsburgh stop of her 1989 World Tour</span></a>
