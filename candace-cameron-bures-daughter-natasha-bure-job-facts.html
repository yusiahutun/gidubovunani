The budding actress followed in her mom’s footsteps and has proven that she has so many incredible talents.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Candace and her husband, </span><a href=#><b>Valeri Bure</b></a><span>, became parents when Natasha was born in 1998. The pair also welcomed son ​​</span><b>Lev Bure </b><span>in 2000 and son </span><b>Maksim Bure </b><span>in 2002. Each of <a href=#>their children</a> has since set their sights on starting their own career paths. In a March 2019 interview with </span><a href=#><i><span>Parade</span></i></a><span>, the eldest Bure child shared why she decided not to go to college.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“When you’re in the entertainment industry, it’s very, very time-consuming. I felt like, for me, school was always the enemy,” Natasha explained. “You have to have super, super good grades to be able to get a worker’s permit to act, and so I just always felt like school wasn’t on my side. Ultimately, I’m happy with my decision to just do my own thing.”</span></p><p><span>The blonde beauty developed a passion for fashion at a young age. Natasha obviously takes after Candace, who sported some iconic looks as D.J. Tanner on </span><a href=#><i><span>Full House</span></i></a><span> beginning in the ‘80s. In fact, the mother-daughter duo even <a href=#>swap outfits and style advice</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“[We share clothes] sometimes!” the Hallmark star told </span><a href=#><i><span>Us Weekly</span></i></a><span> about her daughter in August 2014. “We are starting to. She will take more of my clothes than me taking more of her clothes because I don’t want to be that mom wearing my 16-year-old daughter’s clothes. She takes all my hand-me-downs but sometimes I will buy something intended for me but realize it looks better on Natasha so she will wear it instead.”</span></p><p><span>Natasha is focused on building her career as an actress, model, singer and beauty blogger but still prioritizes spending time with her family. Candace was happy to have a full house again while quarantining with her kids amid the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“Our conversations have been incredible,” she told</span><a href=#><i><span> Us Weekly</span></i></a><span> about <a href=#>spending time at home</a> with her kids in April 2020. “They’ve been great. We’ve been taking lots of walks and playing lots of board games and we’re in sunny California. We have a pool and we’ve been enjoying that too because the weather’s been nice. It’s just been concentrated family time [with] lots of cooking and eating.”</span></p><p><b>Keep scrolling to learn five interesting facts about Natasha.</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46cmKeckZiybq%2FAppyrp55ir7a%2BxKxknZmlnLW1sdFmpZqskai1onnBrqmeZZqkr26ywJyrrGc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./anna-nicole-smith.html><span>←</span><span>Anna Nicole Smith: Latest News, Pictures &amp;amp; Videos</span></a>
