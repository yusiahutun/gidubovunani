With a mix of old and new being represented, the new <strong>Frasier</strong> is seemingly finding its original results again, albeit with a different combination of characters. Here, Dr. Frasier Crane attempts to shed his <strong>Dr. Phil</strong>-like TV persona (which happened between the two Frasier shows) and take on the more prestigious reputation of a genuine Harvard lecturer. He is joined by <strong>Toks Olagundoye </strong>and British sitcom icon <a href=#><strong>Nicholas Lyndhurst</strong></a> who play his colleagues, and his nephew-turned-student David (<strong>Anders Keith</strong>). But his home life is off to a rocky start as he rekindles his relationship with his estranged son Freddy (<a href=#><strong>Jack Cutmore-Scott</strong></a>) who lives with his friend Eve (<strong>Jess Salgueiro</strong>). This revival takes place in Boston, where we first met the character back in 1984, but a lot has happened since then.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>For many, the title Frasier relates specifically to the hit 1993 sitcom that ran for 11 seasons.</strong> The show followed the titular psychiatrist having returned to his hometown of Seattle to work as a radio host and to be closer to his father Martin (<a href=#><strong>John Mahoney</strong></a>). His radio producer Roz (<strong>Peri Gilpin</strong>) often provided Frasier with the tough love needed to push him from his high horse, while his brother Niles (<a href=#><strong>David Hyde Pierce</strong></a>) encouraged his pomposity. Martin's Mancunian carer Daphne (<strong>Jane Leeves</strong>) would become the subject of Niles' Anglophilia and Martin's pet dog Eddie was the cherry on the top of this delicious sitcom sweet. However, as most Frasier fans know, the character's origins began in a Boston bar called <a href=#><strong>Cheers</strong></a> (and a sitcom of the same name), but did you know he also appeared in another show before getting his own?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/frasier-tv-show-poster.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title=Frasier>Frasier</a></h5>TV-PG<p class=display-card-description>Dr. Frasier Crane moves back to his hometown of Seattle, where he lives with his father and works as a radio psychiatrist.</p><strong>Release Date</strong> <span>September 16, 1993</span> <strong>Cast</strong> <span><a data-id href=#>Kelsey Grammer</a> , David Hyde Pierce , Jane Leeves , Peri Gilpin , John Mahoney</span> <strong>Main Genre</strong> <span>Comedy</span> <strong>Seasons</strong> <span>11</span><h2 id=frasier-first-appeared-on-lsquo-cheers-rsquo-in-1984>Frasier First Appeared on ‘Cheers’ in 1984</h2><p>In its early seasons, Cheers could be described as the will-they-won't they story of bar owner Sam (<a href=#><strong>Ted Danson</strong></a>) and academic Diane (<strong>Shelley Long</strong>). After breaking up with Sam at the end of Season 2, Diane is committed to a mental institution where she is treated by none other than Dr. Frasier Crane. When she returns to the show in Season 3, we meet her doctor-turned-boyfriend who was originally intended as just a hurdle in the Sam and Diane relationship story, but became so much more. The role of "Frasier Nye" (as he was called then) was written for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>John Lithgow</strong></a>, but the <strong>Footloose</strong> actor called television "beneath my dignity." <strong>Mandy Patinkin</strong> was considered but recommended his Julliard classmate Kelsey Grammer for the role instead, Grammer recounts on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>The Rich Eisen Show</strong></a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Frasier assisted with Sam's alcohol issues too</strong>, and the character soon became a valued member of the ensemble cast. Diane leaves Frasier for Sam at the altar in the Season 3 finale. For most antagonistic characters (no matter how entertaining), this would mean the end of the road, but Frasier's success on Cheers saw him not only outlast his relationship storyline with Diane, but outlast Diane's character on Cheers altogether. Characters including Lilith (<a href=#><strong>Bebe Neuwirth</strong></a>) and his first wife Nanette (<a href=#><strong>Emma Thompson</strong></a>) were later introduced, this time to specifically service his own storyline. <strong>Cheers sees Frasier endure ups and downs, and ends with him happily married with an infant son, Frederick.</strong></p><h2 id=lsquo-cheers-rsquo-had-two-spin-offs-before-39-frasier-39>‘Cheers’ Had Two Spin-offs Before 'Frasier'</h2><span class=txt>Close</span> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 1987, Cheers writers <strong>Ken Estin</strong>, <strong>Glen Charles</strong>, <strong>Les Charles</strong> and <strong>James Burrows</strong> created the first of the show's spin-offs. <strong>The Tortellis</strong> starred <strong>Dan Hedaya</strong> and <strong>Jean Kasem</strong> reprising their Cheers roles as Nick (ex-husband of <a href=#><strong>Rhea Perlman</strong></a>'s Carla) and his new wife Loretta. The Las Vegas-set sitcom only ran for 13 episodes and was canceled soon after, <strong>but this would be the first of several Cheers spin-offs to follow</strong>. As for Kelsey Grammer, he "wanted to kill Frasier." As Cheers was ending, the actor thought it was time for his character to end too. "I had a deal with Paramount," he said on The Rich Eisen Show, "They said, 'We're going to do another show when Cheers is over, with you.'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"We talked about doing a show about a guy on a motorcycle 'cause I used to ride a motorcycle [...] who's bedridden because he's had a terrible accident." said Grammer of his pitch. "But the President of Paramount, <strong>John Pike</strong> at the time, said this is not funny." It wasn't long before Grammer agreed to Paramount's idea of returning to the character of Frasier Crane. But before he would be given his own Frasier sitcom, <strong>the actor reprised his role in another Cheers spin-off alongside his onscreen wife Bebe Neuwirth</strong>. The show was <a href=#><strong>Wings</strong></a>, which followed two brothers who run a small Nantucket airline called Sandpaper, and although its regular cast members were not originally from Cheers, the overlapping cameos made it clear that Wings existed in "The Frasier-verse."</p><h2 id=kelsey-grammer-39-s-frasier-appeared-on-lsquo-wings-rsquo-in-1992>Kelsey Grammer's Frasier Appeared on ‘Wings’ in 1992</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/frasier-crane-from-planes2c-and-visiting-cranes.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Wings was created by Cheers producers <strong>David Lee</strong>, <strong>David Angell</strong>, and <strong>Peter Casey</strong>, and took place in the fictional Tom Nevers Field Airport. The show, which featured future stars <a href=#><strong>Tony Shalhoub</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Thomas Haden Church,</strong></a> often welcomed many of Boston's best over its impressive eight-season run, including Cliff (<a href=#><strong>John Ratzenberger</strong></a>), Norm (<strong>George Wendt</strong>) and Rebecca (<a href=#><strong>Kirstie Alley</strong></a>). After making his Cheers debut in its third season, Kelsey Grammer made his Wings debut in its own third season too, in the 1992 episode titled "Planes, Trains and Visiting Cranes," a nod to Frasier and Lilith's marital last name.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/friends-fraiser-lisa-kudow-matthew-perry-kelsey-grammer.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="The 'Friends' Star Who Was Fired From 'Frasier'">The 'Friends' Star Who Was Fired From 'Frasier'</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Losing a job is always unpleasant, but in this case, it was a blessing in disguise.</p><p>The episode centers on Frasier's "working vacation" to Nantucket to conduct a low self-esteem seminar. "Yeah, that's my kind of flight," says Roy (<strong>David Schramm</strong>) of the seminar's attendees. "You lose their luggage, they think it's their fault!" It turns out Wings' Helen (<strong>Crystal Bernard</strong>) has personal beef with Frasier after following his advice to disastrous results in the past. <strong>The episode sees Frasier desperately trying to redeem himself</strong> before Helen convinces his seminar attendees that he's a fraud. Grammer's experience on Wings was clearly a positive one, because when it came time to produce Frasier the following year, he wanted the Wings creative team behind him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I approached the guys from Wings, Angell, Casey and Lee" Grammer told The Rich Eisen Show. "I said, 'No kids, no dogs, and no wives.' So we got rid of Lilith not because it wasn't possible to do that show, but [...] I thought we were kind of a one-joke couple." He lost his battle regarding the dog, which became one of Frasier's cutest additions. As for his wife, Frasier arrived in Seattle as a recent divorcee, ready to explore his own relationship psychology throughout the series. Bebe Neuwirth would appear in 12 episodes across its 11 seasons, with their young son Frederick played mostly by <strong>Mad Men</strong>'s <a href=#><strong>Trevor Einhorn</strong></a>, so in a way, Grammer dropped his "no kids" condition, too. Regardless, it's clear that without both Cheers and Wings, Frasier would not be the cultural icon it is today.</p><p>Frasier is available to watch on Prime Video in the U.S.</p><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Watch on Prime Video</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibn6G5qrDEq2Wcp51ks7Ot0qKcq2WTnbKmvtJmrqKml6h8</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ffrasier-cheers-wings.html&text=Before%20%27Frasier%2c%27%20the%20Character%20Appeared%20in%20Two%20Other%20Sitcoms&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffrasier-cheers-wings.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffrasier-cheers-wings.html&title=Before%20%27Frasier%2c%27%20the%20Character%20Appeared%20in%20Two%20Other%20Sitcoms" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ffrasier-cheers-wings.html&title=Before%20%27Frasier%2c%27%20the%20Character%20Appeared%20in%20Two%20Other%20Sitcoms" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ffrasier-cheers-wings.html&title=Before%20%27Frasier%2c%27%20the%20Character%20Appeared%20in%20Two%20Other%20Sitcoms" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffrasier-cheers-wings.html&description=Before%20%27Frasier%2c%27%20the%20Character%20Appeared%20in%20Two%20Other%20Sitcoms" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./israel-discussion-set-at-hebrew-congregation-of-somers.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Israel Discussion Set at Hebrew Congregation of Somers">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./30-vs-60-fps-which-is-better-for-phone-videos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Which Is Better for Phone Videos?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
