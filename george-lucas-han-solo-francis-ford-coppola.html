From the Samurai movies of <strong>Akira Kurosawa</strong> to the legendary structure devised by <strong>Joseph Campbell</strong>, nearly all of it has been extensively analyzed and explained – but not everything! One of the key aspects of the making of Star Wars was Lucas' friendship with a clique of young and ambitious filmmakers like him. You may have heard of them: <strong>Steven Spielberg</strong>, <strong>Francis Ford Coppola,</strong> and <strong>Brian de Palma</strong>. And one of them inspired the creation of none other than Han Solo himself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, none of those legends look anything like <strong>Harrison Ford</strong>, so we're clearly not talking about the looks (all due respect to them), but rather about the attitude of our favorite scoundrel. When coming up with Han Solo, <a href=#>Lucas was inspired by his own friend Francis Ford Coppola</a>. Different as they may be, the legendary filmmaker and the smuggler have a lot more in common than it would seem, and that's what this is about.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/star-wars-a-new-hope-movie-poster.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope">Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope</a></h5>PGActionAdventureFantasy Sci-Fi<p class=display-card-description>A farm boy from a desert planet becomes an unlikely hero in the fight against the oppressive Galactic Empire.

In the original Star Wars, we meet him in the Mos Eisley Cantina as he's negotiating with Obi-Wan Kenobi (<strong>Alec Guinness</strong>) and Luke Skywalker (<strong>Mark Hamill</strong>) to take them to the planet Alderaan. Things quickly take a turn for the worse when his passengers are identified by the Empire as fugitives, but he's promised a handsome reward, so why not?<strong> Han is the kind of guy who trusts his guts as much as he trusts his skills</strong>, and he's not afraid of taking huge risks if he knows the payoff may be equally big. And he always pulls it off.</p><p>That's what George Lucas wanted when using Francis Ford Coppola as one of the basis for Han Solo. Coppola is not a smuggler and his line of work is a lot less dangerous than Solo's, but he has no problem in taking his own huge risks if it means getting his project done. Some time ago, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Coppola himself admitted that Lucas based Han Solo on him</a> precisely because of his daring nature: "George felt that I just took crazy reckless chances, that I would jump off the mountain without knowing what was there to land on, and that I would end up with no money, so he created him. I'm sort of the dashing failure." Of course, no one in their right mind would call Francis Ford Coppola a failure.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/star-wars-rey-daisy-ridley.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="The New Star Wars Movies Plan Is Far Better Than the Last One">The New Star Wars Movies Plan Is Far Better Than the Last One</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>With filmmakers like James Mangold, Dave Filoni, and Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy on board, the future seems bright.</p><p>George Lucas certainly nailed the inspiration, because Francis Ford Coppola and Han Solo do have a lot in common in terms of both of them liking to take risks. The filmmaker's career is one of the most successful in Hollywood, sure, but it's also so filled with great stories, it became the subject of many works itself. For example, Paramount+ is home to <a href=#><strong>The Offer</strong></a>, a series about the making of <strong>The Godfather</strong>, and there is even <a href=#>another whole other feature film in development about it</a>, with Coppola himself being played by <strong>Oscar Isaac</strong>. Another of his classics, <strong>Apocalypse Now</strong>, was a big gamble in terms of production, its story becoming one of the best documentaries about movie production ever made, <strong>Hearts of Darkness</strong>. Even now, Coppola worked directly on <a href=#><strong>The Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone</strong></a> while doing pre-production for <strong>Megalopolis</strong>, <a href=#>his dream project that he funded from his own pocket</a>. It's the worst nightmare of any insurance company.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In Star Wars, Han Solo didn't have to manage multi-million-dollar productions for feature films, but he has his fair share of risk-taking, often putting his and his friends' lives on the line, but, like Coppola, being so sure of his skills, he knew it couldn't go wrong. The Death Star rescue in <strong>A New Hope</strong>, the asteroid field sequence in <strong>The Empire Strikes Back</strong> and the whole rebel attack on the forest moon in Endor in <strong>Return of the Jedi</strong> are perfect examples of how he too "jumps off the mountain without knowing what is there to land on," as Coppola says.</p><h2 id=francis-ford-coppola-was-once-george-lucas-rsquo-mentor>Francis Ford Coppola Was Once George Lucas’ Mentor</h2><span class=txt>Close</span> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>George Lucas was only able to build a character using Coppola as inspiration because they obviously know each other very well, even starting their relationship with one of Coppola's typical risky endeavors. The two of them met as young filmmakers in the Warner Bros. studio lot, right after Lucas won a filmmaking scholarship that put him on the set of <strong>Finian's Rainbow</strong>, a musical starring <strong>Fred Astaire</strong> and directed by then-30-year-old Coppola. They hit it off immediately, consolidating their friendship and collaboration in Coppola's following movie, 1969's <a href=#><strong>The Rain People</strong></a>, a traveling road movie that he wrote and directed while Lucas made a documentary about it.</p><p>Later that same year, Coppola and Lucas would once again come together to start their own production company, <a href=#>American Zoetrope</a>. The whole objective of this was to build an environment that fostered and financed filmmakers to provide them with artistic and creative freedom without having direct studio interference. The first movie by American Zoetrope was Lucas' first proper feature film, sci-fi <strong>THX-1138</strong>, based on his student film of the same name, and in 1973 he would release his second one, <strong>American Graffiti</strong>, under Coppola's banner, too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sadly, not everything can go right all the time, and American Zoetrope faced a lot of trouble for its idealistic view of filmmaking, which made studios think twice before funding projects. But it was still a risk Coppola took, and one Lucas saw firsthand and even took part in, which may also explain why he became so "conservative", according to Coppola. And in the movies, even Han Solo couldn't make it work every time, too – he was frozen in carbonite, almost eaten by giant space worms, and captured multiple times... But the risks paid off (most of the time).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong><strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Star Wars franchise is currently available to stream on Disney+ in the U.S.</p><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">WATCH ON DISNEY+</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibn6G5qrDEq2Wcp51ktKa70aCcZqSlmK60eceapWarn6G8brLRmqWcoaNis7C%2Bw2aaqKigpLmiew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fgeorge-lucas-han-solo-francis-ford-coppola.html&text=George%20Lucas%20Partially%20Based%20Han%20Solo%20on%20This%20Famous%20Director&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgeorge-lucas-han-solo-francis-ford-coppola.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgeorge-lucas-han-solo-francis-ford-coppola.html&title=George%20Lucas%20Partially%20Based%20Han%20Solo%20on%20This%20Famous%20Director" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fgeorge-lucas-han-solo-francis-ford-coppola.html&title=George%20Lucas%20Partially%20Based%20Han%20Solo%20on%20This%20Famous%20Director" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fgeorge-lucas-han-solo-francis-ford-coppola.html&title=George%20Lucas%20Partially%20Based%20Han%20Solo%20on%20This%20Famous%20Director" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgeorge-lucas-han-solo-francis-ford-coppola.html&description=George%20Lucas%20Partially%20Based%20Han%20Solo%20on%20This%20Famous%20Director" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./how-to-make-a-curved-graph-in-excel.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How to Make a Curved Graph in Excel">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./what-are-blended-orgasms.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What are Blended Orgasms &amp;amp; How Do You Have One?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
