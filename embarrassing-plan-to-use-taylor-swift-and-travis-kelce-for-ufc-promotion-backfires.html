Clever, right? Apparently not.</p><p>“Never post Taylor Swift again,” wrote one fan.</p><p>“The UFC intern needs to be fired immediately,” said another embarrassed fan.</p><p>One even went as far as to say: “This is just embarrassing lol. Like this tweet is trying to capitalize on another sports notoriety with absolute 0 connection to the UFC.”</p><p>UFC Vegas 85 will be taking place in Las Vegas on February 3, just a week before the all-important Super Bowl.</p><p>In the days prior, to the game, the Cruel Summer singer will be performing her Eras Tour in Tokyo, and some fans <a href=#>fear she won’t be able to make the game</a>. However, due to the time difference, it is possible she can get to Vegas on time.</p><p>We’ll be keeping our fingers crossed!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-travis-kelce-shuts-down-retirement-rumors>Travis Kelce ‘shuts down’ retirement rumors</h2><p>As the Chiefs made their way into their sixth Super Bowl appearance, whispers began to spread that it may be the 34-year-old’s last game before announcing his retirement from the field.</p><p>However, he’s now seemingly shut these down, as he was filmed telling his teammate Patrick Mahomes he could “do this another 11 years.”</p><p>The star also touched on the subject on his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">podcast</a>, New Heights with brother Jason Kelce, saying he’ll play “until his wheels fall off.”</p><p>“I haven’t found something outside of football that’s going to challenge me like playoff football,” he said. “And I don’t know if I’ll ever find that.
