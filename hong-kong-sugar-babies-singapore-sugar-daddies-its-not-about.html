<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Hong Kong sugar babies, Singapore sugar daddies but its NOT about selling sex, these dating w</h1></header><section class=post-content><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When she wraps up her studies in June, she will take a gap year in Europe, basing herself in a posh house in the fashionable London borough of Camden, owned by her sugar daddy, an expat accountant in Singapore. Still, he’s not making everything easy – he refuses to hire Lily at his company, to avoid a conflict of interest. “My sugar daddy says I have to start from the bottom but he can make a few phone calls for me to get me a job for sure,” Lily says. “I love that I am with a man who is so sure about us and about the future and I know I cannot find that in a boy.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/03/18/e7323d66-2763-11e8-b567-adb1113855b0_1320x770_110301.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Along with relationship security there are, of course, the sweeteners – the iPhone, Macbook Pro, and business class flights on Emirates he has lavished on her – or the Hermès Birkin 30 bag he bought her in Paris.</p><h4 type=h4 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0"><a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Prostitution to redemption: a Chinese farm girl’s journey</span></a></h4><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I can’t remember how much that cost and I didn’t dare look at the price tag,” Lily says. He also gives her a monthly allowance of US$2,200 “on the last day of the month without fail” and tops this up with another US$700 to complement the flights to Singapore he buys her every fortnight so she can shop on Orchard Road while he plays golf. The US$10,000 dollar birthday bash was his way of saying sorry he couldn’t attend the celebration – the date coincided with a business trip.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">With such rewards on offer, it’s easy to see the appeal of sites like The SugarBook. And Lily is far from alone. As of March, The SugarBook had 120,000 users – up from 75,000 at the beginning of the year – mostly from Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines and Indonesia. Its founder, Darren Chan, hopes to grow that membership to 200,000 by June, and sees the China, Indonesia and Thailand markets as ripe for expansion. “The idea for The SugarBook came when I read about how finances are one of the most important criteria in relationships,” Chan says. “I delved deeper and found a study that had a summarised conclusion that men seek beauty while women go for money when it comes to choosing life partners.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/03/18/1a278682-2763-11e8-b567-adb1113855b0_1320x770_110301.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">About 70 per cent of the members on Chan’s site are “sugar babies”, usually aged between 21 and 32. Sugar daddies and mummies range in age from 30 to 55.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The SugarBook, launched in 2016, competes with a US-based website called SeekingArrangement, founded in 2006 by Singaporean Brandon Wade. In Greater China, the website has over 90,000 active members, mostly female aspiring sugar babies. Hong Kong and Macau account for 11,683 active female members.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To boost membership, both platforms are offering free premium accounts to students who register using their university email address, hoping to cash in on struggling students seeking a way to finance their education. SeekingArrangement says this has helped entice more than three million students in the US and Europe to sign up. For those paying to access the sites, a six-month premium package on SeekingArrangement is US$60, on The SugarBook it is US$215.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Critics of sugar dating – roughly defined as an older man or woman spending extravagantly on a younger girlfriend or boyfriend in return for a relationship – say it is little different to prostitution, as sugar daddies often expect more than just companionship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/03/18/eccd0584-2764-11e8-b567-adb1113855b0_1320x770_110301.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s really a kind of marketing where they keep the brand name distinct from prostitution, even though it’s clear the people agreed to have sex for money,” says Helen Pringle, a lecturer at the University of New South Wales who specialises in human rights in the sex industry. “[Sugar dating] creates a sense among many men, a playboy aspiration where they can tell women when they can come and when they can leave and they don’t have to deal with the messy relationship stuff.”</p><h4 type=h6 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0">WATCH: Blind dating in Beijing</h4><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This has prompted concerns in conservative Southeast Asian states. Singapore police have vowed to take action if they suspect The SugarBook is being used to exchange money for sex. One user of SeekingArrangement has already received a two-year prison term – a 45-year-old married man who had sex with a 15-year-old girl he met on the site. The Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission also has threatened legal action if prostitution, blackmail or fraud are suspected.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The SugarBook says it understands the concerns and “will work with the authorities to address any questions and concerns”. It also says that user security is a priority and that it has “stringent procedures in place to ensure no fake accounts, exploitation or vice activities happen”.</p><h4 type=h6 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0">WATCH: No lip reading in this Tokyo speed dating service</h4><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Despite these procedures, soliciting sex is rife. This Week in Asia signed up as a sugar baby and sugar mummy on both services for a week and was offered cash for sex on numerous occasions.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On SeekingArrangement, sugar daddy “Joe” wanted a sugar baby to “massage the stress out of me” after flights from Switzerland to Singapore; “Dan” wanted a pay-per-meet arrangement starting at US$260. On The Sugarbook, “Rao”, 21, said he was “just another student with financial constraints” and was “looking for a sugar mummy” – but without the friendship.</p><h4 type=h4 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0"><a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">‘I was forced to sell my body in a Hong Kong bar’: a Filipino’s tale</span></a></h4><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The rise of these websites poses other problems. Critics say the power dynamic is inclined heavily towards the sugar daddies – and that sugar babies often become depressed when their relationships turn sour. Many self-harm and some attempt suicide when the lifestyle they are used to ends, says Dr Andrew Mohanraj, deputy president at the Malaysian Mental Health Association. “Certain types of sugar babies are led to believe that their relationship will become romantic,” Mohanraj says. “I have one case where the sugar baby was told by her sugar daddy that he wanted to marry her. [This never transpired] so she overdosed on sleeping pills.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Other dumped sugar babies succumb to substance abuse and they are also at risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/03/18/dc010678-2765-11e8-b567-adb1113855b0_1320x770_110301.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Even those who evade physical harm may sustain psychological scars – among them, an inability to see relationships as anything other than transactional.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Even if they put the past behind them and get married and settle down, they might have a distrust of men, particularly older men,” Mohanraj says. “They might pass this kind of thinking to their daughters and tell them to be conscious of men in general.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Mohanraj says colleges could help by banning flamboyant clothes and cars on campus. “I remember when colleges in Malaysia prohibited students from driving expensive cars, but now people look down on poor students.” Pringle, the lecturer, says parents must teach sons about respecting women and daughters the importance of self-respect.</p><h4 type=h4 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0"><a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">‘Boys for Sale’: the dark world of Japan’s gay prostitution</span></a></h4><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">All such advice falls on deaf ears as far as Lily is concerned. She’s planning to introduce her sugar daddy to her parents in April. “If we get married, no one will call him my sugar daddy any more. He will just be my husband, right? So why let these labels determine your life,” she says. “Even if a woman wants to be a sex worker or an escort, it’s legal in Europe anyway and they pay taxes, why judge her? It’s like being a woman means your entire life will be judged already no matter what.” <span class="tw_sectioncolor css-1mniedq eq9i9439" data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-1><span class="courier css-1mniedq eq9i9439" data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0>■</span></span></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Names have been changed</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kxKaxymaYrKGRZMCwr8ieq7JnkafBqq%2FLnmZraWNsfnqDjqGmp59doLyvs4ysrKCZomKvoq7Inqpmq5mjtKK8zqucZqulnK6zecOam52hlah6qsDSZqWorF2Wr7DB0w%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gemma-owen-sunglasses-love-island.html><span>←</span><span>Gemma Owen loves these 49 sunglasses on Love Island</span></a>
