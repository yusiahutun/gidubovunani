Rising to prominence with small roles throughout the 1990s, by the start of the 21st century, Hoffman was an in-demand actor who could portray unlikely heroes just as well as he could play deliciously evil villains. He similarly thrived in tiny indie films and huge blockbusters alike; no film he appeared in ever seemed too big or small for him and his chameleonic acting abilities.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Truth be told, even if Philip Seymour Hoffman appeared in a bad movie, he often proved to still be good, and those genuinely great movies he appeared in were made even greater, thanks to his presence. This makes a rundown of his very best movies and performances difficult to do, but it's worthwhile in any event, and does help demonstrate how great he was. The following movies are among the best Hoffman ever appeared in, and take into account both how good the overall film is and how prominently they feature Hoffman.</p><h2 id=39-charlie-wilson-rsquo-s-war-39-2007><span class=item-num>25 </span><span>'Charlie Wilson’s War' (2007)</span></h2><h3 id=director-mike-nichols>Director: Mike Nichols</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Charlie_Wilson_s_War-563886663-large-Cropped.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A <strong>Mike Nichols</strong> film</a> that takes a darkly comedic look at a true story, <strong>Charlie Wilson’s War</strong> is about the titular Texas congressman and how his actions impacted certain historical events in Afghanistan during the 1980s. <strong>Tom Hanks</strong> stars in the lead role, with a strong supporting cast that includes Hoffman, <strong>Julia Roberts</strong>, and <strong>Amy Adams</strong>.</p><p>It’s a film that <strong>can feel a little scattershot, and perhaps ends up feeling like slightly less than the sum of its parts</strong>, though many of those parts are undeniably impressive.

Given the strength of the overall cast, Hoffman doesn’t stand out here quite as much as usual, but he’s still as reliably great as ever.

That made it all the more noteworthy when he was given the opportunity to be a film’s main character, as is the case with 2002’s <strong>Love Liza</strong>, a small-scale character study that’s simultaneously a comedy and drama, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">depicting a man struggling with grief</a> after his wife’s sudden death.</p><p>It’s safe to say his grieving process is particularly strange and harrowing, but Love Liza still tries to find some humor in the darkness of it all. That can make the film one that’s tonally odd, and <strong>it probably goes without saying that it’s not going to be the kind of thing for everyone</strong>. However, given its overall quality and the fact it contains a strong lead performance from Hoffman, it is worth checking out for any fans of the actor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch on Tubi</a></span></p><h2 id=39-scent-of-a-woman-39-1992><span class=item-num>21 </span><span>'Scent of a Woman' (1992)</span></h2><h3 id=director-martin-brest>Director: Martin Brest</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/scent-of-a-woman-philip-seymour-hoffman.jpg><p>Admittedly, <strong>Scent of a Woman</strong> is a movie that more or less belongs to <strong>Al Pacino</strong>, given he hams it up in the leading role and gives a truly bombastic performance; <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one that finally got him an Oscar win</a>, too. But that doesn’t mean this drama about the unique bond that forms between a blind U.S. Army officer (Pacino) and the student hired to care for him lacks compelling supporting performances.</p><p>Scent of a Woman also has one of Hoffman’s earliest roles, here playing a fellow student of <strong>Chris O'Donnell’s</strong> Charlie, who’s the one hired to look after the retired officer. It wasn’t quite a breakout role for Hoffman, as <strong>the next couple of years of his career had him playing similarly small roles</strong>, though it was a high-profile and successful movie, so it did contribute somewhat to his overall rise, which was more noticeable by the decade’s end.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rent on Apple TV</a></span></p><h2 id=39-nobody-rsquo-s-fool-39-1994><span class=item-num>20 </span><span>'Nobody’s Fool' (1994)</span></h2><h3 id=director-robert-benton>Director: Robert Benton</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/nobody-sfool-1.jpg><p>Speaking of relatively small supporting roles Philip Seymour Hoffman had in the early to mid-1990s: <strong>Nobody’s Fool</strong>.

It’s loosely inspired by real-life events, and is overall extremely entertaining and a breezy watch, also feeling noteworthy for its remarkable ensemble cast, including Philip Seymour Hoffman, <strong>Bill Nighy</strong>, <strong>Nick Frost</strong>, <strong>Emma Thompson</strong>, and <strong>Kenneth Branagh</strong>, to name just a few.</p><h5 class=display-card-title>Pirate Radio</h5>R<p class=display-card-description></p><strong>Release Date</strong> <span>April 1, 2009</span> <strong>Director</strong> <span>Richard Curtis</span> <strong>Cast</strong> <span>Michael Hadley , Charlie Rowe , Lucy Fleming , <a data-id href=#>Philip Seymour Hoffman</a> , <a data-id href=#>Tom Sturridge</a> , Ian Mercer</span> <strong>Runtime</strong> <span>135 mins</span> <strong>Main Genre</strong> <span>Comedy</span><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rent on Apple TV</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=39-mission-impossible-iii-39-2006><span class=item-num>18 </span><span>'Mission: Impossible III' (2006)</span></h2><h3 id=director-j-j-abrams>Director: J.J.

That antagonist’s name is Owen Davian, and he’s played excellently by Philip Seymour Hoffman, who gives a performance as a terrifying arms dealer that’s somehow both quietly menacing and bombastic; never going too far in either direction.</p><p>The rest of the movie around Hoffman is still pretty good, with some stylish action sequences and the overall polish one would expect from a big-budget Hollywood action movie. Mission: Impossible III may be overshadowed now by some of the truly excellent entries in the franchise released in its wake, but it’s still well worth a watch, <strong>with Philip Seymour Hoffman’s villainous turn being a huge reason the entire film works as well as it does</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Mission: Impossible III">Mission: Impossible III</a></h5>PG-13ActionAdventureThriller<p class=display-card-description></p><strong>Release Date</strong> <span>May 5, 2006</span> <strong>Director</strong> <span><a data-id href=#>J.J.
