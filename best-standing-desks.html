According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mayo Clinic</a>, research has linked prolonged sitting with obesity and associated health concerns like high blood pressure, abnormal cholesterol levels, and an increased risk of cancer or heart-related diseases.</p><p>Thankfully, there’s a solution in consumer-friendly <a href=#>adjustable standing desks</a>. As the name implies, a standing desk allows you to stand and work to relieve some of the stresses of sitting and improve how you feel throughout the day.</p><p>When shopping for a standing desk, there are a few things to think about. Like any office desk, the biggest deciding factor will be size. Standing desks come in a variety of shapes and sizes, from more compact options to sprawling L-shaped surface areas. Measure the space you have and consider what you need to use the desk for. If it’s just going to be a simple workstation for your laptop, you can probably get away with a smaller desk or even a standing desk converter, which sits atop an existing desk and has its own adjustable workspace.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Desktop size isn’t the only measurement to think about for your new standing desk. While most standing desks should achieve a suitable height for the average user, if you’re taller or shorter than the average adult, be sure your new desk accommodates your needs. A good rule of thumb to follow is that you should be able to use your keyboard or mouse comfortably with your elbows at a 90-degree angle.</p><p>Once you’ve settled on a comfortable height, there are just a few more aspects of <a href=#>your new standing desk</a>. Some options let you choose the material of your desktop or whether you want to have under-mounted drawers or monitor stands installed. Think about your office space and how different accessories may enhance your productivity or maximize your space.</p><p>With all of this in mind, it’s time to go shopping, and we’ve made things a little easier with a roundup of some of the best standing desks on the market.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><td colspan=3 style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p><strong>How Did We Research</strong></p></td></tr><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p>Models Evaluated</p></td><td style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p>Hours Researched</p></td><td style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p>Reviews Analyzed</p></td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p>12</p></td><td style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p>4</p></td><td style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p>20</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>How-To Geek's product recommendations come from the same team of experts that have helped people fix their gadgets over one billion times.

These include reduced strain on the neck, back, arms, and wrist, along with improved circulation in the legs. Prolonged sitting has been linked to obesity and associated conditions like high blood pressure, increased blood sugar, and more body fat.</p><p>However, Harvard Health Blog author <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Robert H. Shmerling, MD</a>, states that, while switching to a standing desk may be beneficial in the long term, there may be “side effects” if not integrated properly. To prevent pain associated with standing longer than your body is used to, insert gradually increasing periods of standing into your work day.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3>How tall should a standing desk be for my height?</h3><p>While there isn’t a universal formula for determining the best standing desk height, a good rule of thumb is to find a desk that’s high enough for your elbow to remain at a 90-degree angle while comfortably working your keyboard and mouse.</p><h3>What is the difference between a standing desk and a standing desk converter?</h3><p>A standing desk is a standalone unit with a motorized lift that adjusts the height of the entire desktop. A standing desk converter is a smaller unit that sits atop a desktop and features its own adjustable workspace. Converters can be portable and can be found in electronically, pneumatically, or manually powered models.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGiZnqukYsC1rc2doKefXZmytLfSaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./513798-karanja-kibicho-multi-million-lodge-owned-by-interior-ps.html><span>←</span><span>Karanja Kibicho: Inside Multi-Million Lodge Owned by Former Interior PS</span></a>
