Weighing 1.18kg, the Gamakay is a predominantly molded plastic build, which fits the retro-ish vibe the LK75 gives off.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/09/gamakay-lk75-keyboard-media-control-knob-top-down-muo-logo.jpg><p>Internally, multiple layers of silicone help reduce typing noise and cushion the switches and overall impact of your keystrokes. In combination with the Gamakay Phoenix switches, this is absolutely one of the quietest mechanical keyboards I've used. We'll talk more about the Phoenix linear switches in a moment (and there is an LK75 audio typing example), but the construction of the LK75, along with its pre-lubed stabilizers and multiple silicone layers, really reduces the typing sound to a minimum. Of course, there is always some typing sound, but even the infamous space bar sound is drastically reduced.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Stylistically, Gamakay is onto a winner here. The PBT MDA profile keycaps are printed with a host of different symbols and icons, all relating to Adobe Photoshop. As a non-Photoshop user, these are of little use to me, but I'm assured they match Photoshop's shortcuts, and anyway, they look awesome. The printing quality on these keycaps is high quality and doesn't look like it will scrub off easily, and it makes for a unique keycap set that you won't find elsewhere. I'd be surprised if Gamakay didn't start offering this set as a standalone buy because I'm sure it would have many takers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/09/gamakay-lk75-keyboard-keycaps-up-close-side.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But on that, there is zero mention of the Adobe Photoshop-inspired keycaps in the box. The "Photoshop Preset Functional Keypads" (to give them their proper name) are mentioned on the website, but surely a little nod in the keyboard manual would be useful.</p><p>Either way, these are great, and I love them.</p><p>In the top-right of the Gamakay LK75 is a programmable media control knob with a TFT LCD screen, which you can use to directly control volume, change RGB settings, brightness, and more. Or, like me, you can display the MakeUseOf logo in its full glory.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/09/gamakay-lk75-keyboard-phoenix-switches-close-up.jpg><p>I'm not sure about the specific resolution of this tiny TFT screen, but the MUO logo looks decent enough. At other times, you can attempt to count the individual pixels present. Still, as a quick heads-up on the current time of day and the remaining battery life of the LK75, it's useful enough.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=connectivity-and-battery-life>Connectivity and Battery Life</h2><p>You'll be pleased to know the Gamakay LK75 has three connection modes: wired, Bluetooth, and 2.4GHz wireless.</p><p>The inclusion of a 2.4Ghz USB dongle is a great addition, with the dongle nestled neatly behind a sliding cover beneath the Page Down key. It pairs with impressive speed, and the connection is strong. The keyboard goes to sleep relatively quickly (to save battery), but the connection is quickly reestablished after a keypress—there is very little waiting around. It's worth using the 2.4Ghz where possible. You'll experience almost zero input lag, and the 2.4Ghz dongle offers a faster polling rate than the Bluetooth connection, which is important when gaming.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/gamakay-driver-desktop-software-add-image.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>I was also impressed with the transition speed from wired to 2.4Ghz. As soon as you disconnect the USB-C cable, the 2.4Ghz USB dongle picks up the connection, and you can continue typing.</p><p>The Gamakay LK75 has a 5,000mAh battery. Running the LK75 using 2.4Ghz wireless and with full RGB gives you between three and four days of usage. Switching the RGB lighting off will massively increase this figure, but I don't have a specific number of days. Still, given the LK75 isn't really a portable mechanical keyboard, you're unlikely to venture too far from a USB-C charger, so it shouldn't be too much of a concern.</p><h2 id=switches-and-typing-experience>Switches and Typing Experience</h2><p>I'm testing the Gamakay LK75 with a set of Phoenix linear switches. Now, these are some of the softest switches I've ever used, and they're certainly bordering on mushy. The Gamakay Phoenix switches have an actuation force of 40g and a total travel distance of 3.3mm. It's a short distance, and because the actuation force is so light, you'll find yourself bottoming out the keys easily.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/gamakay-driver-desktop-software-home-page.jpg><p>However, the shallow Phoenix switches are designed for silence, and in combination with the layers of sound-dampening silicone, the LK75 is a very quiet keyboard. You can hear just how quiet the LK75 is in the keyboard audio example below:</p><p>It really is one of the quietest mechanical keyboards I've used, and could be the perfect option for someone who wants to take a mechanical keyboard into the office without enraging their colleagues.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The typing experience is subjective, of course, but as someone who spends all day every day typing, I'm pleased with the LK75's performance. Again, the slightly too-soft Phoenix switches factor into this, and I believe most people would prefer slightly more resistance. If that sounds like you, the Gamakay LK75 has several other switch options, including the linear Jupiter switch (50g) or the tactile Pegasus switch (45g).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/09/gamakay-lk75-keyboard-rear-switch-and-usb-port.jpg><p>You'll find the gaming experience similar. The Phoenix switches are supremely responsive because of the lightweight actuation force, but you may also find yourself tapping the odd wrong key occasionally, which can be frustrating. Still, in combination with the 2.4Ghz wireless, the LK75 is decent enough for gaming, making it a worthwhile mechanical keyboard for office and gaming use.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=customization>Customization</h2><p>As is becoming de rigueur in the mechanical keyboard world, the LK75 features hot-swappable switches. Gamakay uses three-pin switches, but the LK75 also supports five-pin switches, so you have plenty of options. The switches are easily removable, and you shouldn't have any issues swapping them out. I popped some Gateron Brown switches into an empty slot, and everything worked fine.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/09/gamakay-lk75-keyboard-media-control-knob-top-down-muo-logo.jpg><p>Similarly, if you're using a Cherry MX-compatible switch, you can swap the LK75 keycaps out for almost any alternative—but given how good these look, why would you?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Gamakay has developed a desktop customization tool named Gamakay Driver. It's decent enough and is where you'll upload your images or GIFs to display on the TFT screen.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>One Gamakay Driver tool feature I really like is the Community tab, from which you can share or download community-created lighting schemes, images, and more for your keyboard.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some of the lighting schemes on offer were horrendous, but I could see this being a useful tool for Gamakay users, especially if the number of users grows.</p><p>However, at times, the software is painfully slow. Switching between the regular and functional layer on the main page takes an age, and while I appreciate Gamakay showing which function keys are programmed (but not labeled), it needs to be a bit faster.</p><h2 id=should-you-buy-the-gamakay-lk75>Should You Buy the Gamakay LK75?</h2><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Gamakay LK75 retails for $120</a>. It's a difficult price point, it has to be said.</p><p>The LK75 keycap set is excellent, and the printing is really high-quality. For this alone, I'm pleased with the LK75. I found the typing experience with the Gamakay Phoenix switches good, if a little soft, and the additional switch options available to would-be buyers should give enough choice for any user. Including the TFT screen knob with some extra functionality is a handy feature, but it's not something everyone will use. I've enjoyed having the MakeUseOf logo on the screen, and playing a GIF on a keyboard is novel, but to what end?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As said, it's a competitive and challenging price point. For the same price, you can grab the Akko ACR Pro 75 with Akko's CS Crystal Switches—a highly-rated 75%. Or, for around 30-40 bucks more, you could grab the all-metal wired Keychron Q1 (you'll have to spend more for the <a href=#>wireless Keychron Q1 Pro</a>).</p><p>So, yes, perhaps the Gamakay LK75 is slightly more expensive than it should be, but the keycaps and typing experience should at least mean you give the LK75 a proper chance—especially if you use or want to learn Adobe Photoshop.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/09/gamakay-lk75-keyboard-media-control-knob-top-down-muo-logo.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title>Gamakay LK75</h5>7<span>/ 10</span><p class=display-card-description>The Gamakay LK75 mechanical keyboard offers a unique design with its Adobe Photoshop-inspired keycaps, programmable TFT-screen knob, and Gamakay Phoenix switches that ensure a quieter typing experience.
