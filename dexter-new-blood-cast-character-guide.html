It's been eight years since audiences have seen Dexter Morgan (<strong>Michael C. Hall</strong>) slice and slash his way through the streets (and residents) of Miami. Now he's back in business with the upcoming limited revival series, <strong>New Blood</strong>. This time around Dexter is trying to put his murderous tendencies behind him while living in the small town of Iron Lake, New York. Despite his self-exile and attempt to have a normal life, it's fair to say that it's only a matter of time before Dexter begins to feel the inexorable pull of his Dark Passenger, leading him back to his old habits.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The initial announcement of the revival series lead to a flutter of fan speculation about which of the series' recurring characters (if any) would be returning alongside America's favorite serial killer. Now that we’re approaching New Blood’s premiere, let's take a look at the new faces and returning favorites that the series has to offer.</p><h2 id=dexter-morgan-jim-lindsay-michael-c-hall>Dexter Morgan/Jim Lindsay (Michael C. Hall)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/dexter-new-blood-michael-c-hall.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dexter returns as the vigilante serial killer we all know, except this time he's going by the alias Jim Lindsay. Ten years after the events of the 2013 series finale in which he faked his death, and cut ties with his girlfriend and son, Dexter is now living off-the-grid in New York. He's hoping to keep his Dark Passenger at bay and live a quiet life away from Dexter Morgan and all the baggage (and secrets) that comes with him. But is his new life sustainable? Can Dexter really resist the urge to kill that has plagued him his whole life? It seems almost too good to be true. As Dexter begins to form close relationships with the residents of his new small town, it might only be a matter of time before someone uncovers his secrets and Dexter's carefully constructed world comes crashing down.</p><p>Aside from his Emmy-nominated role as Dexter Morgan, Hall also starred as David Fisher in all five seasons of the series <strong>Six Feet Under</strong>, as well as appearing in <strong>Safe</strong>, <strong>Star vs. the Forces of Evil</strong>, and <strong>The Defeated</strong>. He can also be seen on the big screen in fims such as <strong>Kill Your Darlings</strong>, <strong>Cold in July</strong>, and <strong>Game Night</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>All the Serial Killers of 'Dexter' Ranked, From Best to Bloodiest</a></span></p><h2 id=debra-morgan-jennifer-carpenter>Debra Morgan (Jennifer Carpenter)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DexterNewBlood_101_4131_R.jpg><p>Fans of the original series will remember that <a href=#>things didn't quite turn out well for Deb</a> in the final episode of the series. It's a plot point that led fans wondering just how New Blood will resurrect the beloved character. Showrunner <strong>Clyde Phillips</strong> previously stated that the show will be treated as a “second finale” rather than a new season of the show, so we know that Deb’s death will remain canon. Now, from trailers and other promotional materials that feature <a href=#>Jennifer Carpenter</a>, it looks as if Deb will be appearing to Dexter as a <a href=#>"corner of Dexter's mind"</a> that helps him weigh the pros and cons of his choices, like a conscience. Fans haven’t had the chance to see the degree to which her death has affected Dexter, so it will be interesting to see if the writers utilize her character in his hallucinations to dive deeper into his psyche. Of course, she could also return in the show’s signature flashback sequences.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While her starring role as Debra Morgan for all eight seasons of Dexter's previous iteration was arguably Carpenter's breakout television role, she has also starred in series like <strong>Limitless </strong>and <strong>The Enemy Within</strong>, as well as guest appearances in <strong>The Good Wife</strong> and <strong>Robot Chicken</strong>. But even while shooting Dexter, Carpenter remained close to the horror and suspense genres by starring in films like <strong>Gone</strong>, <strong>The Factory</strong>, <strong>The Devil's Hand </strong>and, most notably, <strong>The Exorcism of Emily Rose </strong>and <strong>Quarantine</strong>.</p><h2 id=molly-parker-jamie-chung>Molly Parker (Jamie Chung)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/jamiechungdexter.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Molly is a new character to the Dexter-verse. She enters the story as a true-crime podcaster and self-made journalist which, as you can imagine, might not bode too well for Dexter and his desire for his past to remain buried. According to <strong>Jamie Chung</strong>, Molly is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“sassy, unapologetic, and a damn good armchair detective"</a> who "adds a new threat to Dexter and his true identity.” While it's unknown how crucial of a role she will play in New Blood, her presence in the series seems poised to shake up Dexter's recently quiet, peaceful world.</p><p>On the television front, Chung has recently appeared as Ji-Ah in <strong>Lovecraft Country</strong> and Mulan in <strong>Once Upon a Time</strong>, as well as Valerie Vale in <strong>Gotham</strong> and Clarice Fong/Blink in <strong>The Gifted</strong>. She can also be seen in films like <strong>Premium Rush</strong>, <strong>Grown Ups</strong>, <strong>The Hangover Part II</strong>, <strong>Big Hero 6</strong>, and <strong>Office Christmas Party</strong>.</p><h2 id=angela-bishop-julia-jones>Angela Bishop (Julia Jones)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Michael-C-Hall-and-Julia-Jones-in-Dexter-New-Blood.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Angela is the first Native American police chief in Iron Lake who, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">according to Julia Jones</a>, has a longstanding "romantic connection" with Dexter and "they definitely have a journey” together. Dexter hasn't exactly had a smooth history with police authority figures — remember Maria LaGuerta (<strong>Lauren Vélez</strong>)? — so it will be interesting to see if his romantic feelings towards Angela make him a bit clumsy when it comes to covering up his tracks, and his true self. During a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Comic-Con @Home panel</a>, showrunner Clyde Phillips revealed that Dexter would be using her to gain <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“access to certain pieces of information that an ordinary citizen would not be able to get”</a> so it seems like Dexter is already navigating a slippery slope.</p><p><strong>Julia Jones</strong> has had a long career of supporting and main roles in varied television series. She can be seen as Kohana in <strong>Westworld</strong>, Stephanie Littlecrow in <strong>Goliath</strong>, and Sally in <strong>Rutherford Falls</strong>, in addition to appearances on <strong>ER</strong>, <strong>Longmire</strong>, and <strong>The Mandalorian</strong>. On the big screen she is known for playing Leah Clearwater in the <strong>Twilight</strong> franchise, as well as appearing in <strong>Wind River</strong> and <strong>Cold Pursuit</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=arthur-mitchell-quot-trinity-killer-quot-john-lithgow>Arthur Mitchell/"Trinity Killer" (John Lithgow)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/27dexter-600.jpg><p><a href=#><strong>John Lithgow</strong> is set to return </a>as the fan-favorite “Trinity Killer” Arthur Mitchell despite the character finding himself on Dexter’s kill table in the Season 4 finale. Thirteen years have passed since Lithgow chilled us with his portrayal of the serial killer and family man, igniting speculation if he’ll be able to slip into the role just as easily as before. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lithgow was expected to film only for one day</a>, leading to the assumption that his part in the revival is limited to a handful of scenes. Either way, his performance as Trinity was equal parts frightening and captivating, leading Lithgow to earn an Emmy for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series for the role in 2010.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During Lithgow's storied career spanning nearly 50 years, he has turned in memorable starring performances in television such as Dick Soloman in all 139 episodes of <strong>3rd Rock from the Sun</strong>, Barney's father in <strong>How I Met Your Mother</strong>, Winston Churchill in <strong>The Crown</strong>, as well as roles in <strong>Trial & Error</strong>, <strong>Perry Mason</strong>, and the upcoming series <strong>The Old Man</strong> (2022). When he's not appearing on the small screen, he can also be seen in films like <strong>The World According to Garp</strong>, <strong>Footloose</strong>, <strong>Harry and the Hendersons</strong>, <strong>Cliffhanger</strong>, <strong>Shrek</strong>, <strong>Rise of the Planet of the Apes</strong>, <strong>Interstellar</strong>, <strong>Bombshell</strong>, <strong>Pet Sematary</strong> (2019), and the upcoming <strong>Killers of the Flower Moon</strong>.</p><h2 id=harrison-morgan-randall-jack-alcott>Harrison Morgan/Randall (Jack Alcott)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/dexter-3.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Jack Alcott</strong> plays a now grown-up Harrison, Dexter's son that he abandoned in the series finale.

Now, after spending time in foster care, Harrison somehow manages to track down Dexter to where he's living in Iron Lake. But what remains to be seen is how the reunion between father and son will go. Does Harrison hold a grudge toward Dexter for abandoning him, or does he merely want to reconnect and get answers to the questions he seeks?</p><p>Alcott is a relative newcomer to the acting world, though he can be seen in an episode of <strong>The Blacklist</strong> as well as a recurring role in the mini-series <strong>The Good Lord Bird</strong>.</p><h2 id=kurt-caldwell-clancy-brown>Kurt Caldwell (Clancy Brown)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/dexter-new-blood-cast-photos-Clancy-Brown.jpg><p><a href=#><strong>Clancy Brown</strong></a> will play the show's main villain, the owner of the local truck stop and unofficial mayor of Iron Lake.
