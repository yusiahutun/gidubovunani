The camera is motion activated, so you will receive updates any time it recognizes movement from one of your chickens. Real-time notifications are sent straight to your phone through the paired app. We also love the two-way sound feature, in case you need to scare off any predators by yelling through the camera.</p><p>Thirty days of cloud storage is included with the camera, and you can purchase a separate SD card for additional storage, if needed. We'd recommend going for the Lite version rather than the AI option since you won't be using the camera to identify birds.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLvUp6ursZyew6q6xmeaqKVfobansY6koJ2rXaWytb%2BOoGtvb2dnfXl%2BjpucrKxdmLWqr8qepWabn6S9bq%2FAppyrmaNk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./niecy-nash-betts-dahmer-critics-choice-awards-plunging-gown.html><span>←</span><span>The Rookie's Niecy Nash is a goddess in curve-enhancing strapless gown</span></a>
