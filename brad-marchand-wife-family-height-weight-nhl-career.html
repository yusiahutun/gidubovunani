He has played for his country at under-17 level before representing them on the big stage of the World Cup of Hockey, achieving a lot in the process.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Biography of Brad Marchand</span></strong></h2><p><span>The hockey player was born and called Bradley Kevin Marchand on May 11, 1988 in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.&nbsp;Since childhood, Brad has practiced this sport which will make him known with his father, Kevin Marchand, who was also his coach.</span></p><p><span>All of Marchand’s history was lost in his love of hockey, the sport he played most of his life.&nbsp;As a kid, he played minor hockey in the Nova Scotia area before playing in the QMJHL for four seasons.&nbsp;Without hockey, Brad said he would have ended up as a police officer.</span></p><h2><strong><span>NHL Career</span></strong></h2><p><span>Marchand made it to the National Hockey League in 2006 after being selected in that year’s draft by the Boston Bruins as the 71st overall pick.&nbsp;However, it wasn’t until 2009 that he made his debut against the Nashville Predators.&nbsp;He scored his first goal in a match against Jhonas Enroth in November 2009. He has now become a very important player for his team.</span></p><p><span>In his first full year with the team which was the 2010-2011 season, Brad recorded 21 goals.&nbsp;During the same season, he was voted 7th player by the supporters of the Bruins club.&nbsp;In 2018-19, when he played 630 total NHL games, Brad had already scored 233 goals and assisted for 250 goals.</span></p><p><span>Apart from the quality of his game and his style which can easily be described as dirty, he has become popular for his affection on the ice, which involves kissing and sometimes licking the necks and faces of other players to a point as advised by NHL administration.</span></p><p><span>On the home front, Brad Marchand represented Canada at the 2016 World Cup of Hockey, helping his team win gold and becoming the tournament’s top scorer.&nbsp;Before that, he played for his national junior team at the 2007 and 2008 Ice Hockey World Junior Championships before being part of the 2016 IIHF World Championships.&nbsp;Interestingly, Brad came back from all assignments with gold medals.&nbsp;The only time he earned a bronze medal was at the World Under-17 Hockey Challenge in 2005.</span></p><h2><strong><span>family and wife</span></strong></h2><p><span>Brad Marchand comes from a large family, no stranger to athletics.&nbsp;Her father, Kevin Marchand, has coached her since childhood and, according to the NHL star, is her best coach.&nbsp;Other members of his family include his mother, Lynn Marchand, and his grandparents, Melissa Lavallee and Robert Marchand.&nbsp;Brad also has three siblings, one brother Jef Marchand and two sisters, Melissa Marchand and Rebecca Marchand.</span></p><p><span>The hockey player is a married man.&nbsp;He tied the knot with his girlfriend, Katrina Sloane in 2015. Although there are no reports on how the two met, it was revealed that Katrina has a son named Sloan. , from a previous relationship who her husband has now adopted as his son..&nbsp;As a couple, Brad and Katrina were lucky enough to have a child born in the summer of 2017.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Height and width</span></strong></h2><p><span>Clearly, Brad is a man with good size and bodybuilding that helps complement his hockey skills, allowing him to become the good player he is.&nbsp;While not necessarily the tallest you can find on a hockey pitch, the left wing player still has a good height of 175cm and a weight of 181kg (82kg; 12lb).</span></p><h3><strong><span>Net value</span></strong></h3><p><span>There’s no denying the fact that Brad Marchanda has worked hard over the years which has translated into success in the NHL as well as his national team.&nbsp;Thanks to this, the Canadian professional hockey player has an estimated net worth of $25 million.&nbsp;Needless to say, most of his fortune has been made through the sport he has always loved and practiced.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGiaopaxbrnAq5qhmZ6Zeri1xZ5kn5mdnrm6eceeoKCgpGLEprXGoatmppiheqSt0Z6cq2c%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbrad-marchand-wife-family-height-weight-nhl-career.html&text=Brad%20Marchand%20Wife%2c%20Family%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20NHL%20Career&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbrad-marchand-wife-family-height-weight-nhl-career.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbrad-marchand-wife-family-height-weight-nhl-career.html&title=Brad%20Marchand%20Wife%2c%20Family%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20NHL%20Career" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbrad-marchand-wife-family-height-weight-nhl-career.html&title=Brad%20Marchand%20Wife%2c%20Family%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20NHL%20Career" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbrad-marchand-wife-family-height-weight-nhl-career.html&title=Brad%20Marchand%20Wife%2c%20Family%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20NHL%20Career" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbrad-marchand-wife-family-height-weight-nhl-career.html&description=Brad%20Marchand%20Wife%2c%20Family%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20NHL%20Career" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./spirittea-spirits-guide-all-spirit-locations-how-to-unlock-them.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Spirittea Spirits Guide: All Spirit Locations &amp;amp; How to Unlock Them">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./best-hunter-pet-sod.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Best Hunter Pet SoD">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
