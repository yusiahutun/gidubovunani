<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Hong Kong taxi fares could go up by 17% if industry proposal accepted by authorities, including a HK</h1></header><section class=post-content><a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Hong Kong</span></a> authorities are considering whether to give the green light to a taxi industry request for a fare increase of up to almost 17 per cent, including a jump in the flag-fall rate for red cabs in urban areas from HK$27 (US$3.45) to HK$32, amid pledges to improve the standard of service from cabbies.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Transport and Logistics Bureau said on Monday that it would discuss the proposal with lawmakers and the Transport Advisory Committee before it made recommendations to the Executive Council, the city’s key decision-making body.</p>A paper submitted to the legislature said the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">taxi industry</span></a> proposed a fare increase last March, designed to cover the three types of taxis operating in urban areas, the New Territories, and on Lantau Island.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It suggested a HK$5 increase for the flag-fall rate for red cabs in urban areas to HK$32, a HK$4.50 rise for green taxis in the New Territories and HK$6 for blue ones on Lantau Island – a uniform rate of HK$28.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/08/9386cafd-ce9b-4dc6-8979-40b3f0039fa2_4096c4b3.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The industry also suggested an increase in the incremental charge for the first-tier distance travelled after the flag fall to HK$2.10 for red taxis, HK$1.90 for green cabs and HK$1.80 for blue ones, a range between 10 and 20 HK cents.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The average rates for the fare increases would be 16.95 per cent for urban taxis, 15.37 per cent for the New Territories and 11.68 per cent for Lantau.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The latest statistics show that, after inflation was factored in, the average net income of cabbies in urban areas recorded an 6.2 per cent increase a month last year to HK$21,767.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">That compared with pre-pandemic levels of about HK$19,360 a month in 2019.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Green cabs showed a 0.8 per cent increase and blue taxis recorded a 2.7 per cent fall in average net income last year.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A bureau spokesman suggested that the taxi trade still suffered from the after-effects of the pandemic for some months, despite the last fare increase in July 2022.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Operating expenses in 2023 rose significantly compared with the 2019 levels, including a surge in insurance costs of nearly 60 per cent and an average increase in repair and maintenance costs of about 30 per cent,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He added it would be tough for the industry to maintain financial viability under the present fare structure.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The bureau said in the paper submitted to the legislature that it would “carefully review fare increase applications” based on five main considerations.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">They included the need to strike a balance between vehicle supply and passenger waiting time, the financial viability of taxi operations and public acceptance of the proposed increases.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Hong Kong taxi drivers seek to raise flag fall charge by 20% amid higher costs</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The two other criteria were the maintenance of a reasonable gap between taxi fares and public transport charges, and the need for the incremental charge to decrease in line with the length of the journey.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Authorities added in the Legco paper that they would improve the quality of cabs by inviting the industry to apply for taxi fleet licences later this month.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Authorities said earlier such fleets would be able to design distinctive liveries and markings and to charge customised fares for prearranged trips.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The bureau spokesman said further information would be released later this year and that it was hoped the new fleets would be operational by the middle of 2025.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He added that the bureau had also learned of the industry’s plans to introduce six-seater taxis, as well as the present four- and five-seater vehicles.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The legislature’s transport panel is expected to discuss the proposed fare increases on Friday.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Scott Leung Man-kwong, a lawmaker and member of the Legco transport panel, said that he understood the taxi industry’s difficulties, but predicted a substantial increase in charges would create a domino effect that could worsen its problems.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It may signal other businesses that it is about time for price hikes,” he added.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Especially when the taxi industry’s image is so negative, if it can’t fix its quality problems, people will just opt for alternatives, such as online car-hailing services.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Hong Kong police recruit volunteers to help passengers avoid taxis overcharging</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The government last July proposed the introduction of a two-tier penalty system for some taxi trade offences, including overcharging, refusing or neglecting to take a hire, and causing damage to, or alteration of, a taximeter.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A HK$10,000 fine and a six-month jail term for a first conviction were proposed as maximum punishments.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The penalty for further convictions would also be increased to a maximum fine of HK$25,000 and 12 months in jail.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The bureau said at the time the proposed penalty system was designed to hit repeat offenders with heavier penalties to boost the deterrent effect.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There are 18,163 taxis in the city – 15,250 red cabs, 2,838 green ones in the New Territories and 75 blue ones on Lantau.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The industry has said in the past that ride-hailing services, such as Uber, were its main competitor, and that they cost the traditional trade an estimated HK$20 million in revenue a day.</p><p class=postsid
