The 23-year-old American pugilist has walked across the looming lightweight division to conquer it all, thereby holding four world titles and an undefeated record of 16-0 under his name. Meanwhile, it has urged fans from several countries to know more about the Arkansan native.</p><p>While Lopez proudly represents his American nationality, he has a different ethnicity that goes back to the time of World War II. Lopez never had things handed to him, as he beat several odds in his life to reach where he is at today. Nevertheless, he is already a top-tier boxer and a superstar athlete in the making.</p><p>As ‘Take Over’ continues to take over the boxing world, here’s a look back at his family, nationality and religion, and where exactly the lightweight world champion comes from.</p><a href=# class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b transparent-card"><img id="img-tag-boxing-news-update-is-teofimo-lopez-still-with-top-rank-next-fight-contract-details?utm_campaign=internal_links&utm_medium=dive_deeper&utm_source=website-embed-image" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-1144061059-1-464x315.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b card-content">UPDATE: Is Teofimo Lopez Still with Top Rank? Next Fight & Contract Details</p></a><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Teofimo Lopez–Love and Life of ‘Take Over’</h2><p>According to the reports of <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>ESPN</a>, Lopez’s grandfather was born in Spain, but later shifted to Honduras after World War II. He did several businesses over there and also raised a family, giving birth to Teofimo Lopez Senior. But it was a rough phase as Senior struggled hard to find a way through life.</p><p>Lopez Sr. landed up in the United States of America, where his son <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Teofimo Lopez Jr.</a> was born on July 30, 1997. Representing the Christian heritage and Honduran roots, Lopez Jr. was born in Brooklyn. However, he suffered complications in his boxing journey. In the 2016 Olympics, the United States of America didn’t pick Lopez in their team.</p><p>So, the boxer turned towards Honduras and stepped up to compete in the grandest sporting event ever. Meanwhile, 16-year-old Lopez was also helping her mother, when she was then working as a bartender in a strip club. Lopez Sr. was struggling with his addiction. It wasn’t easy for a young Teofimo to deal with all that.</p><p>“My mom’s loyal. She’ll always ride with him (Lopez Sr.). No matter what. She was a bartender at a strip club. I would help her as a barback. I was 16,” said ‘Take Over’.</p><p>Coming from a troubled childhood, Lopez has turned the tables for himself and his family in the most spectacular way possible. He is now one of the most promising world champions of the active roster. Further, many <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>reports</a> suggest he already boasts of a reported net worth of $2.5 million, thereby proving that dreams do come true.</p><p>Watch This Story: <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Five Insane Facts About Mike Tyson</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pr%2FSnqWtoZGhubq%2Fz6ipratemLyue8Gor6Kml2K7psPSZq6hnaKaeqq%2FjK2cqJ6ZorxuuM6pnLNllqe8rnnNmquip56WuarA2GapnqSZnLawuoyapZ1llam1r7XCoquyZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./strawberry-twirl-chocolate-arrives-uk-31070595.html><span>←</span><span>Strawberry Twirl chocolate arrives in UK but Brits can't get over the price tag</span></a>
