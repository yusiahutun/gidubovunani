She was raised in the city of San Diego, California but has little to say about her education.&nbsp;Given that she started her acting career at a very young age, she is most likely being tutored at home by her parents or employed tutors.&nbsp;Raegan Revord has been described as a nature actor and the reason is not far fetched.&nbsp;She fell in love with acting and began auditioning at an early age.&nbsp;In fact, she has no memory of her first audition.</span></p><p><span>Revord began her career as a child model when she was just four.&nbsp;She appeared in advertisements for various companies such as Enterprise, Toyota, Little Tikes and Mattel.&nbsp;Her natural talent was evident in these commercials, and a family friend (who was also a talent agent) offered to represent her.&nbsp;Raegan Reford switched to acting when he was six.&nbsp;Her first role came in the popular sitcom&nbsp;</span><span>Modern Family</span><span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;Between 2014 and 2016, she played the recurring role of Megan on the series.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Career Achievements</span></strong></h2><p><span>Since that humble debut, Raegan Revord has appeared in over 10 films and TV series.&nbsp;On the big screen, she has appeared in films such as&nbsp;</span><span>Turtle</span><span>&nbsp;(2015),&nbsp;</span><span>Jia</span><span>&nbsp;(2015),&nbsp;</span><span>Stray</span><span>&nbsp;(2017),&nbsp;</span><span>Wish&nbsp;</span><span>Up</span><span>&nbsp;(2017) and&nbsp;</span><span>I See You</span><span>&nbsp;(2017).&nbsp;The latter is a drama that follows a man who intends to commit a terrorist attack.&nbsp;However, he experiences a change of heart when he comes into contact with a young child.&nbsp;In the film, Revord plays the role of a little girl named Amy.&nbsp;On the other hand, Wish Upon focuses on a young woman named Clare who discovers the deadly consequences of using a magic box.&nbsp;In the film, Revord plays a young version of Clare.</span></p><p><span>Raegan Revord also found success on the small screen.&nbsp;She has appeared in TV shows such as&nbsp;</span><span>Modern Family, Young Sheldon, Teacher, with Bob</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>David, Grace and Frankie</span><span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;Grace and Frankie is a Netflix series.&nbsp;It follows that two women try to move on with their lives after discovering that their husbands are not only colleagues but also lovers.&nbsp;The series debuted in 2015 and has received positive reviews.</span></p><span>On the other hand, the teacher focuses on some elementary school teachers trying to raise good students while dealing with problems in their own lives.&nbsp;Revord portrays a young college student named Melinda on the series.&nbsp;Raegan Revord has won multiple awards throughout her childhood career.&nbsp;She was nominated for Best Supporting Actress in a TV Series at the 2018 Young Artist Awards.&nbsp;She didn’t win, but there is no doubt that she would win many awards in the future.</span><h2><strong><span>parents</span></strong></h2><p><span>There isn’t a lot of information available on Revord’s family background.&nbsp;The names of her parents are not known.&nbsp;There are also no details about siblings in their lives.&nbsp;Despite this lack of information, there’s no doubt that her parents helped make her a star.&nbsp;They did not question her decision to become an actress at a young age.&nbsp;They rather encouraged her and even moved to LA to give her the right opportunities.&nbsp;Her parents also manage many aspects of her career, including her social media accounts.&nbsp;Revord has a sizeable online following.&nbsp;She has more than 170,000 followers on Instagram and more than 6,000 on Twitter.</span></p><h2><strong><span>More Raegan Revord facts</span></strong></h2><p><strong><span>1.</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Despite her young age, Revord has a charitable heart.&nbsp;She is a junior ambassador for a children’s hospital in LA.</span></p><p><strong><span>2.</span></strong><span>&nbsp;She has three beloved puppies.&nbsp;Two of them are of Maltese breed while one is a Terrier mix.</span></p><p><strong><span>3.</span></strong><span>&nbsp;She hopes to also become a writer, director and equestrian when she grows up.</span></p><p><strong><span>4.</span></strong><span>&nbsp;The young actress is an avid reader and spends her free time reading books.</span></p><p><strong><span>5.</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Raegan Revord loves cheese and as such doesn’t quite follow the vegan lifestyle.</span></p><p><strong><span>6.</span></strong><span>&nbsp;She is an animal lover and hopes to one day start a rescue animal farm.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><p class=postsid
