And while the couple didn't meet through Russell's first love of football, perhaps this was fortune as it left the 34-year-old plenty of time to fall for the 'Promise' singer instead!</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Ciara celebrates her life with Russell and their children</figure><p id=eMxhh-3wudw2 data-wc=70>It was Russell who made the first move, as he asked Ciara to accompany him on a dinner date to make the most of the chemistry which they'd sparked at the sports game. The date was a success, leading to the pair making their relationship official at the White House Correspondents Dinner on April 28, 2015 – a date which would go on to have <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>further significance</a></strong> for the couple.</p><p id=eu7tPNb7uIBn data-wc=18><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Ciara and Russell Wilson have candid argument in hilarious video as fans all notice the same thing</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/99d7be3d45d9-ciara-and-russell-wilson-relationship-timeline-1.jpg><p id=eYzYVjM6a3UZ data-wc=63>In March 2016, Russell <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>proposed to Ciara</a></strong> while they were on vacation in the Seychelles. A representative for the couple later told <strong><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>People</a></strong> magazine: "Russell proposed to his new fiancée at the romantic private 'Honeymoon Beach' located on North Island." Ciara officially announced the pair's engagement via an Instagram post which featured a photo of the moment, and the caption: "I feel complete."</p><h2><strong>Are Ciara and Russell Wilson married?</strong></h2><p id=epnJjTjBc__W data-wc=53>Yes, following their engagement in March, the A-list couple <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>tied the knot</a></strong> on July 6 2016. Ciara and Russell's wedding ceremony was a secretive affair, performed at Peckforton Castle in the UK. But although the guestlist was small, among the couple's close friends attending were Kelly Rowland, Jennifer Hudson and La La Anthony.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/93d6727add97-ciara-and-russell-wilson-relationship-timeline-3.jpg><p id=eS8tX8oBO3Fe data-wc=78>For the ceremony itself, photos <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>which the couple shared</a></strong> of the event show Russell looking handsome in Giorgio Armani coattails and Ciara stunning in a white laced gown with bell sleeves and a lace-up corset which was designed by the then-creative director of Roberto Cavalli, Peter Dundas. The 'Get Up' singer completed her bridal look with a long veil and a bouquet of white roses. "We are The Wilsons!" celebrated the couple <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>on social media</a></strong> after the ceremony.</p><h2><strong>How long have Russell and Ciara been together?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/af6d4841ba7f-ciara-and-russell-wilson-relationship-timeline-8.jpg><p id=enurkEmkpNro data-wc=56>Ciara and Russell have now been together for over eight years, and the celebrity pair will soon be celebrating their seventh wedding anniversary. For <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>their fifth anniversary</a></strong> as a married couple, the '1, 2 Step' artist revealed via Instagram that she and the former Seattle Seahawks player had jetted off for a romantic time in Italy.</p><p id=enCMKpgIoQOG data-wc=5><strong>SEE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Ciara's best fashion moments</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eFBMOwPa5i2F data-wc=44>Celebrating their Europe trip, Ciara penned on one post from the sweet vacation: "5 Years & Forever To Go.

Ti Amo Tanto Mi Amore."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/c61052a3631b-ciara-and-russell-wilson-relationship-timeline-7.jpg><p id=eFWq30TYpLCw data-wc=88>On the pair's sixth anniversary in 2022, Russell wrote a tribute which went back to their very first meeting in 2015. "I walked into the room for the first time…and I was speechless. Not because I didn’t have the words to say, but because God answered my prayers," the NFL star captioned his post. "God has blessed us for the past 6 years of Marriage with our 3 beautiful children and an overflow of laughter, love, & life. Cheers to forever. Happy Anniversary… I Love You Mrs. Wilson."</p><h2><strong>Who is Ciara's ex-husband?</strong></h2><p id=eYoYljct83oS data-wc=44>Prior to her relationship and marriage to Russell, the All You've Got actress previously dated the rapper Future. The couple got engaged in October 2013 after a year of dating, and welcomed a child together, a son (<strong><a class=hm-link href=#>named after his father</a></strong>), in May 2014.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/d2032d462a5e-ciara-and-russell-wilson-relationship-timeline-9.jpg><p id=eUUC_dbmXX7b data-wc=40>However, after Future faced allegations that he'd cheated on the singer, Ciara <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>called off their engagement</a></strong>. The couple now share joint custody of Future Jr., meanwhile Russell became the 8-year-old's step dad following his and Ciara's marriage in July 2016.</p><h2><strong>Do Ciara and Russell have kids together?</strong></h2><p id=euljLdy0Yqfw data-wc=27>Yes, Ciara and Russell share three children. Future is a proud half-brother to <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>his sister Sienna</a></strong>, born April 28 2017, and <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>brother Win</a></strong>, born July 23 2020.</p><p id=eJ0rRzLbH6Qd data-wc=51>Speaking on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in March 2022, <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Russell surprised Ciara</a></strong> with a question about whether the R&B artist would be willing to consider having another child. "Serious question. Can we have more babies?" he asked, although the football player had been joking around with the audience just seconds before.</p><p id=epfjUg8WDJCs data-wc=70>Despite the light-hearted scenario, Ciara responded to the surprise question genuinely. "We definitely can," she said, "But we've got a little time before we get there," she admitted. The couple have yet to make any further comments on the possibility of welcoming another member to the Wilson family, but as it's one year on from the pair's appearance on the talk show it is possible we may hear something soon.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/819c8a744d57-ciara-and-russell-wilson-relationship-timeline-4.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/332275806df1-ciara-and-russell-wilson-relationship-timeline-5.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/4c6afa9b7d38-ciara-and-russell-wilson-relationship-timeline-6.jpg><p id=eZ2s11Wc2xHS data-wc=6><strong>Read more <a class=hm-link href=#>HELLO!
