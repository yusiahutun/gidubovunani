There were others who seemed disappointed with the new products, claiming the strawberry-flavoured option carries an "artificial" taste.</p><p>Even though the treats are now up for grabs in the UK, the chocolates are not part of an official UK launch by Cadbury. The company admitted it doesn't specifically sell them in the UK, and has no plans to roll them out across supermarkets nationwide.</p><p>At the moment it appears they are only available at B&M stores where customers can pick up strawberry and Caramilk flavours. It's not confirmed when they first started being sold at the store.</p><p>The new flavours arrived after Cadbury mixed things up a little with their product lines. Recently shoppers were shocked to find normal-sized Twirls in party packs known as "Heroes", but there's a reason why it happened.</p><p>The brand confirmed the UK would see a shake up in regards to the sizes of the chocolate bar. It was noted mini versions of Twirl bars would no longer be available on the run up to <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Christmas</a> as a result of supply chain issues.</p><p>A spokesperson said: "To ensure we can continue to bring our loyal consumers the products they know and love, we have temporarily substituted bite-size Cadbury Twirl in Heroes Tubs, to the slightly larger Cadbury Twirl 21g. Rest-assured consumers can enjoy the same amount of chocolate as before with the overall weight of the product remaining the same."</p><p><b><i>Want all the biggest Lifestyle news straight to your inbox? <a data-content-type=section data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Sign up for our free Daily Star Hot Topics newsletter</a></i></b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKqVlrluuMifnGirpKeuuK7Eq6myZaSstrO4jJyfqJufoa61sYyaqauhpprAbsHKZmpqaGdlgnqB</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mindy-kaling-very-rare-photos-daughter-kit-so-grown-up.html><span>←</span><span>Mindy Kaling shares very rare glimpse of daughter Kit and she's so grown up</span></a>
