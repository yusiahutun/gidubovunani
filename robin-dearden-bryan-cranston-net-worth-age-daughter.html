(1980), Breaking Bad (2008), and Matt Houston (1982).</span></p><p><span>Please tune in to the article to know about her more!</span></p><h2><span><strong>Married Life of Robin Dearden With Husband Bryan Cranston</strong></span></h2><p><span>Dearden is married to an iconic actor Bryan Cranston and has a daughter named Taylor Dearden Cranston.</span></p><p><span>Their first time met was quite the sexy one. When they both shared a role in the same episode of the TV show Airwolf, which aired from 1984 to 1987, they ended up getting married later on.</span></p><p><span>Cranston played the role of the bad boy in the episode, whereas Robin was one of the hostages, and Cranston’s character held a gun to her head.</span></p><p><span>Cranston explained that they had some chemistry right away from their meeting. They didn’t have to play pretend and could be themselves around each other, but both were in a relationship with other people at that time.</span></p><p><span>However, Cranston actually credits their long-lasting marriage, saying</span></p><p><strong><span>“We didn’t have the need to make the move. We were able to play and flirt and yet, to not have anything go any further than that. So we were able to really be ourselves.”</span></strong></p><p><span>Their first meeting sure was strange, but their engagement story is more of a mixed strange and unique in its own way. Cranston was the one to show out his feelings for her the first, and he felt that he would burst into tears if he looked at Dearden while proposing.</span></p><p><span>So, the Breaking Bad star planned to propose while bathing together <strong>“facing the same direction.”</strong>&nbsp;As the engagement ring couldn’t be hidden anywhere, with his tricky, creative mind, he thought of just a bit more than ordinary way. He put it on his baby toe, and when the moment arrived, he lifted his leg and said, <strong>“Here’s your ring, but I can’t reach it. Take the ring off my toe.”</strong></span></p><p><span>Dearden feeling his love and affection, accepted it wholeheartedly and felt really romantic about the moment.</span></p><p><span>Their relationship even goes on to be more amusing afterward. With the toe proposal, Bryan also made his marriage more enjoyable by pulling a prank at the altar during their wedding. The two tied the knot in 1989, vowing to be together with each other at any time.</span></p><p><span>After marriage, obviously, comes a honeymoon trip, some naughty tradition, and that is the case for Robin and Bryan, too. They chose to go on a five-week tour of Europe for their honeymoon.</span></p><p><span>On their honeymoon, the couple booking a journey from Switzerland to Italy by train, on the advice of a travel agent, who informed them that they would be able to stay inside their car as the train passed through three pitch-black tunnels.</span></p><p><span>The travel agent added that the third tunnel was 50-minute long. So not letting go of this chance, they performed their honeymoon rituals right on the train. But the only trouble was, they only had fifteen minutes, not 50. They were in the epitome of lovemaking, feeling the ecstasy of each moment they were having, and suddenly they get illuminated.</span></p><p><span>The shocked and naked duo were in the clear view of their fellow passengers, while nearby men seemed to get a real kick out of it. One old lady with her horrified grandchildren was clearly not amused, who gave him a <strong>‘You!’</strong> look.</span></p><p><span>Robin and Bryan both love to watch people. They have quite a thing for mainly observing the people around them and their behavior. But gaining fame towards their sides has made them unable to do so.</span></p><p><span>They were once spotted in Hawaii while taking a stroll. But they were in full relaxation mode and enjoyed the scenic stroll in Hawaii, walking side by side.</span></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbiz.com/images/celebs/robin-dearden-husband-bryan-cranston.jpg alt="robin dearden husband bryan cranston" width=650 height=520 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><span><strong>Robin Dearden with her husband Bryan Cranston (©:The Knot News)</strong></span></p><p><span>The couple reportedly was caught off guard by this recent pandemic. They both tested COVID positive. Thankfully, their symptoms being mild, they were able to recover soon enough but not fully.</span></p><p><span>Apparently, the couple also has been attending couple therapy for years. If one wants to go, others can’t object, so they go together from time to time. It helps to tune up their relationship, like having a relatively damaged car serviced.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Robin and Bryan had a lovely daughter named Taylor Cranston on February 1, 1993. Their little girl also chooses to take up the path of her parents in acting. She is an alumnus of the University of South California, where she majored in theatre, graduating in 2015.</span></p><p><span>Since 2010, she started to appear in several shows and films, starting as playing a sad girl in an episode of Breaking Bad. And in the coming years, she landed roles in short films while getting praise for her acting. Now, she has made quite a name for herself in the film industry.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Robin Dearden N<strong>et Worth, &</strong> Career</strong></span></h2><p><span>Robin Dearden made her acting debut in the late 1970s as a cast on ‘The Krofft Superstar Hour.' Shortly after, she had another short role as Joleen Collins in ‘The Incredible Hulk.’ In 1978, she landed a role in the TV series ‘Man Undercover.’ The following year, Robin starred in the TV series ‘Family’.</span></p><p><span>This was later followed by small roles in movies like ‘Trouble in High Timber Country,’ ‘Fugitive Family,’ and ‘The Asphalt Cowboy,’ before she came into the limelight with ‘Magnum, P.I.’</span></p><p><span>She had her first major role in the popular TV series ‘Magnum, P.I’ appearing for more than one episode. She shone with her performance in the series, which got the attention of many filmmakers. As a result, she started getting more longer appearances on TV series and shows.</span></p><p><span>In 1985, she starred in the comedy film ‘Stitches,’ and three years later, she was cast in another film, a 1988 action-packed movie, ‘Big Turnaround.’ Following those, she was part of films like ‘Last Chance (1999), ‘The Shrink Is In’ (2001), ‘Wooly Boys’ (2001), ‘Myron’s Movie' (2004), ‘Illusion’ (2004), and ‘Grounded for Life'&nbsp;(2005).</span></p><p><span>She also made a cameo appearance in the third season of ‘Breaking Bad’ in 2010, playing a highly emotional woman. Her most recent appearance is a voice-over for a character in the animated movie ‘Fantasy Hospital’ (2010).</span></p><p><span>But, in recent times, she is pulling back from the film industry and appears less. However, she has not announced her retirement outright.</span></p><p><span>Being cool and secretive, she has kept quiet about her personal matters, including her net worth. With all the appearances she has made over time in TV shows and films, she must have collected quite the fortune. However, her husband, Bryan Cranston, has an estimated net worth of over $40 million, and her daughter’s net worth is speculated to be over $7 million.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Who Is Robin Dearden? Age</strong></span></h2><p><span>Robin Dearden was born on 4 December 1953 in Los Angeles, California. She is the daughter-in-law of Joe Cranston and the sister-in-law of Kyle Edward Cranston.</span></p><p><span>Any information regarding her past days, especially her childhood, education, and family, is not disclosed as she is quite a private person.</span></p><p><span>Robin stands at the height of 5 ft 3 in or 1.6 m tall. She weighs 67 kg. She is more of a calm and cool character.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6CzZpOkunCvxKWcm6qZqbamv46rppuhnmKxpq3RnZynZZKnxqK6jJypmqajqbyvec2eq2avn6fBqXnAoJxmnJGqtKnAxKs%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2frobin-dearden-bryan-cranston-net-worth-age-daughter.html&text=Married%20Life%20Details%20of%20Robin%20Dearden%20With%20Husband%20Bryan%20Cranston&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frobin-dearden-bryan-cranston-net-worth-age-daughter.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2frobin-dearden-bryan-cranston-net-worth-age-daughter.html&title=Married%20Life%20Details%20of%20Robin%20Dearden%20With%20Husband%20Bryan%20Cranston" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2frobin-dearden-bryan-cranston-net-worth-age-daughter.html&title=Married%20Life%20Details%20of%20Robin%20Dearden%20With%20Husband%20Bryan%20Cranston" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2frobin-dearden-bryan-cranston-net-worth-age-daughter.html&title=Married%20Life%20Details%20of%20Robin%20Dearden%20With%20Husband%20Bryan%20Cranston" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frobin-dearden-bryan-cranston-net-worth-age-daughter.html&description=Married%20Life%20Details%20of%20Robin%20Dearden%20With%20Husband%20Bryan%20Cranston" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./antonella-cruz-sanchez.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mnica Cruz, Penlope Cruzs Sister Is Also In The Entertainment Business ">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./man-intentionally-hit-by-car-twice-at-popular-tiktok-motel-north-bergen-pd.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Man Intentionally Hit By Car Twice At Controversial TikTok Motel: North Bergen PD">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
