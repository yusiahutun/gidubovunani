She expressed her passion for the culture that shaped her during the show, frequently expressing this by dressing in classic designs but with a contemporary twist.</p><p>Tolú&nbsp;quickly grew close to Winnie Ilesso during her tenure on the show, as the two bonded over their love of Nigerian culture. Julie Theis became a close friend as well.</p><p>The first major disruption at Tolú’s house occurred when Simone Stewart and Juelz Morgan emerged from the vault to declare that they had chosen to take the option that would have allowed them to increase the trust by $5,000 but required them to prevent two individuals from voting in the initial trust ceremony. Tolú was dismayed to hear from Juelz that she was one of the two who was unable to vote. She discussed this with her companions, who cast the vote to remove Juelz on her behalf.</p><p>Tolú was content with the relationships she had made in the house, although she did grow resentful of Jacob “Jake” Chocholous when he chose to send Bryce Lee to the vault but not her, despite his claim that his ability to vote had been restricted. She expressed her displeasure that Jake frequently dubbed her “African,” claiming that she prefers to be recognized for her Nigerian heritage and has never identified as such.</p><p>Tolú spoke with Jake when Julie insisted, and he was able to resolve the matter. She was, however, also cautious of Julie’s devotion to him because of the way the latter had voted Simone out in order to keep Jake alive.</p><p>Tolú spoke with Jake when Julie insisted, and he was able to resolve the matter.
