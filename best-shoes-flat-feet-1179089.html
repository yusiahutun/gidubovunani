And complains about ’em, too!&nbsp;Flat feet, the health condition in which a person’s arches are very low or completely absent from their foot, causing them to walk with their feet flat against the ground, is incredibly common. For some, it’s NBD, but depending on how severe the condition is, it can sometimes be painful to even walk—that’s why it’s important to know about the <a href=#>best shoes for flat feet</a> and where to buy them.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>Finding the right shoe is important for anyone, regardless of whether or not they have a foot condition, so knowing the most supportive styles out there can benefit us all. If you’ve ever gotten blisters from too-tight <a href=# id=auto-tag_shoes data-tag=shoes>shoes</a> or walked around in heels all night (and maybe ended up barefoot, much to my own embarrassment!), then you know just how life-changing <a href=#>a comfortable shoe</a> can be. For people with flat feet, the right pair can be paramount to their well-being.</p><p>While you can be born with flat feet, you can also develop them as you age, sometimes out of nowhere and other times&nbsp;as the result of other conditions such as arthritis, diabetes or injury. We use our feet literally all day long, whether we’re walking around, working out or walking to the fridge for a snack, so <a href=#>taking care of them</a> is important—and that starts with wearing the right shoes..</p><p>When it comes to shoes that people with flat feet should avoid, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Dr. Emily Splichal</a>, a podiatrist and human movement specialist based in New York, says that excessively flat shoes or “zero drop” styles may cause stress to a flat foot, especially if the person is going to be standing for long periods of time. (Sorry, toss those thin-soled, <a href=#>sandals and flip-flops</a> from last summer in the donation bin.) “If this type of shoe is going to be worn, I suggest a supportive insole to make the otherwise non-supportive shoe more supportive,” Dr. Splichal advises.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/AdobeStock_276772015.jpeg><p>When it comes to the very best shoes for flat feet, Dr. Splichal says to pay close attention to features beyond whether or not <a href=#>you think they’re cute</a> (although that matters, too!) “Flat feet or overpronation is typically associated with the foot needing a little extra support, as it can fatigue or get stressed easily,” she says. A well-cushioned shoe might be the first thing you think of when it comes to the comfort factor, but it’s actually more about <a href=#>the well-structured sole</a>. “Footwear that is more supportive may benefit this foot type. Looking for features such as a heel counter, a stiff midsole and slight heel-to-toe drop all make a shoe more supportive,” says Dr. Splichal.</p><p>The good news is, there are plenty of supportive options for shoes for flat feet on the market right now, so you don’t have to worry about sacrificing style for comfort. You definitely don’t need to succumb to wearing <a href=#>clunky grandpa shoes</a> in order to get through the day—though, if you’re into those, we won’t judge!</p><p>Below, check out our favorite cute <a href=# id=auto-tag_boots data-tag=boots>boots</a> and <a href=# id=auto-tag_sneakers data-tag=sneakers>sneakers</a> for flat feet that still feel fashion-forward. We’ve also included a few supportive <a href=# id=auto-tag_insoles data-tag=insoles>insoles</a>, in case you’ve already fallen in love with a non-supportive pair of shoes that you just can’t seem part with.</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
