known as the Afro black-skinned lady who starred in the film,&nbsp;</span><span>Deadpool</span><span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;For the love of entertainment, Zazie, in each and every one of her films, has kept her fans glued to the screens.&nbsp;She shows so much acting ability on set and hasn’t stopped wowing her many fans since her debut.</span></p><p><span>Before her big break with the movie, Deadpool, the rising star was involved in many other supporting roles on television shows, drama series, and sitcoms.&nbsp;She is a very private person who has hidden from the media for most of her life.&nbsp;In this article, AnswersAfrica has compiled all the facts about them.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Zazie Beetz’s Bio (Age)</span></strong></h2><p><span>Born on June 1, 1991 in Charite, Berlin-Mitte, Germany, Zazie was christened Zazie Olivia Beetz by her German father and African American mother.&nbsp;Her father Thomas was born in East Germany, but he emigrated to the United States after the fall of the Berlin Wall and met his wife Michelle, a social worker in the United States.</span></p><p><span>Zazie’s elementary school education was in Berlin, although she grew up in Uptown Manhattan, New York and earned a French degree from Skidmore College.&nbsp;The actress’ flair for acting was born when she was in elementary school, where she participated in community theater and local stages.&nbsp;She later trained at a number of theater institutes, including the Harlem School of Arts and LaGuardia Arts High School.</span></p><p><span>Before her acting debut, she was an employee at the Alexa Center, works at its H & M store.&nbsp;Once she retired from the business to focus on her acting career, she landed a role in the short film.&nbsp;</span><span>Crocotta</span><span>&nbsp;(2013).&nbsp;The following year she starred in the short film&nbsp;</span><span>Beasts</span><span>&nbsp;(2014), which later paved the way for bigger roles like her roles in films like&nbsp;</span><span>Apple Sauce</span><span>&nbsp;(2015),&nbsp;</span><span>Wolves</span><span>&nbsp;(2016),&nbsp;</span><span>Geostorm</span><span>&nbsp;(2017),&nbsp;</span><span>Dead Pigs</span><span>&nbsp;(2018),&nbsp;</span><span>Dead Pool</span><span>&nbsp;(2018) and&nbsp;</span><span>Joker</span><span>&nbsp;(2019).</span></p><span>Besides acting in films, Zazie has also taken part in quite a few television series and shows.&nbsp;She starred in the series&nbsp;</span><span>Atlanta,&nbsp;</span><span>Easy</span><span>&nbsp;and more.&nbsp;She has won multiple awards for her collection for her amazing performances on set.&nbsp;She was nominated for a Choice Award for Choice Summer Movie Actress in 2018 for her performance in&nbsp;</span><span>Deadpool 2</span><span>&nbsp;and Prime Time Emmy Awards nominated her for her performance in the comedy series Atlanta.</span><h2><strong><span>parents,&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span>boyfriend or husband</span></strong></h2><p><span>Lack of information about the actress’ love life, Zazie Beetz has consciously hidden all her love escapes from the public.&nbsp;To the best of our knowledge, she hasn’t dated anyone yet, which rules out the fact that she could be married, but we do know that she’s likely in a relationship with actor David Rysdahl.&nbsp;The two are often seen on social media sharing their intense love for each other.&nbsp;In some of her pictures that she has uploaded to Instagram, she has revealed her love affairs with the actor.</span></p><p><span>For his part, David Rysdahl is also one of the lynchpins of the acting world.&nbsp;Not only is he an actor, but he is also a talented writer with a unique difference.&nbsp;At the very young age of seven he was introduced in the film,&nbsp;</span><span>Children of Eden</span><span>&nbsp;(1991).&nbsp;David is also a practicing doctor, having worked as a doctor before deciding to focus on acting and writing as a career.&nbsp;He has written and starred in a few films including&nbsp;</span><span>The Revival</span><span>&nbsp;(2017) ,&nbsp;</span><span>Dead Pigs</span><span>&nbsp;(2018)&nbsp;</span><span>, The Cure</span><span>&nbsp;(2019) among others.&nbsp;As previously mentioned, Zazie’s parents are Thomas and Michelle Beetz.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Body stats – weight and height</span></strong></h2><p><span>Needless to say, the Deadpool star is a beauty to behold.&nbsp;Her smooth chocolate skin gives her a stunning look.&nbsp;The very hairy female stands at 5ft 6in and weighs 55kg.&nbsp;She has brown hair and eyes of the same color.&nbsp;Zazie Beetz wears a bra size 32B and measures 32-23-32 inches for her bust, waist and hip sizes.</span></p><h3
