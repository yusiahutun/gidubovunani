In the video, the TikToker approached the camera, stating, “No N word (explicit) when I got him done (explicit).”</p><p>As the video gained popularity, Escudero faced widespread criticism, ultimately leading to the cancellation of her TikTok account. Adding fuel to the controversy, The Tea Tok, a gossip page on Instagram, <a href=# data-type=link data-id="https://www.instagram.com/p/C146qkyPXAI/?img_index=1" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reposted</a> the video of Escudero using a racial slur in the initial slide.</p><p>Likewise, on another slide, they featured a screenshot from Notfromco’s TikTok, with overlaid text stating, “Me going to delete my duet with Isa after she got exposed for being racist.”</p><p>Accompanying the post, the Instagram gossip page captioned, “#isabelescudero is facing widespread cancellation on TikTok due to a video where she is alleged to have used the N word,” along with a shocking emoji.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Upon seeing the post, numerous fans and followers expressed their opinions on the matter. One individual inquired, “Was she lip-syncing to a song, or did she just say it? It’s horrible either way; I’m just confused.”</p><p>Meanwhile, another person remarked, “She’s also a bully; I remember her classmates exposed her.” Despite hate comments, some argue that the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">N-word</a> has evolved into a slang used by everyone, especially in music, and should not be seen as inherently racist in certain contexts.</p><p>Shortly after this post, The Tea Talk <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reshared</a> another video, this time featuring Isa’s internet twin, Trey Howe. In the video, he addressed the situation, saying, “I don’t know if you guys saw the video, but Isa got canceled.”</p><p>“You were commenting on my post, which was fun for a little bit, but can’t have it anymore. The moral of the story is, don’t say things you’re not supposed to say, especially when the phone is recording,” he added.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>“You’ve got to think smart, especially when you have so many followers and attention on you. If you do wrong, it will blow up bigger than usual. Think about the most possible bad scenarios for everything you do and just don’t do that,” Howe concluded.</p><p>Following the post, many of the fans supported Howe’s statement. One person said, “When someone gets canceled, they are the only ones responsible for their actions. No one else,” while another person highlighted the importance of avoiding racist behavior, commenting, “Don’t say it? How about don’t be racist lol.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Isa Escudero’s short bio</h2><p>Isa, known by her full name Isabel, began her TikTok journey in August of 2023.
