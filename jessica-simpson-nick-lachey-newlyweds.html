In the book, she calls Nick her "first love" and says he was attracted to "the fact I was so strong in my faith and that I had this wide-eyed innocent approach to life."</p><p>That "wide-eyed innocent approach to life" was partly due to the fact she was only 18 when they met and the two shared an 8-year age gap.</p><p>"I respect Nick very much. I was really young and my success hadn't really begun. He knew me as this young innocent 18-year-old that had never been introduced to the world in so many ways," she writes. "I went straight from my father to him. Nick's very smart. He was eight years older than me, but he was also young."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:9d1c7987-5a4d-5a12-9870-42ac705521f6 data-container-ref=toofab:article:d2e0f83e-7617-5d43-952c-ce1a70344fc7 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/f2/5by4/2020/01/22/f243f8519205548997e76a5f58b85f11_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Jessica Simpson Reveals Sexual Abuse, Drinking and Pill Problem and Hitting Rock Bottom</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Saying that she "didn't know myself" at the time they were together, things cooled when the cameras weren't on them.</p><p>"We were young and pioneering our way through reality television, always miced and always on,," she explains. "We worked and we were great at it but when it came time to being alone, we weren't great at it anymore."</p><p>"We really got crushed by the media and by ourselves," she added. "I couldn't lie to our fans and I couldn't give somebody hope that we were this perfect golden couple."</p><p>She asked for a divorce in 2005, saying that at the time they "were not even speaking to each other."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:60ec3939-e56e-5b16-8fc5-8b76812da3ab data-container-ref=toofab:article:d2e0f83e-7617-5d43-952c-ce1a70344fc7 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/a1/5by4/2020/01/22/a126a27bb1ae53a3bbac3b4c3dc7c09c_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Jessica Simpson Took Diet Pills for 20 Years After Tommy Mottola Told Her to Lose Weight</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>While it didn't work out in the end, Simpson said the two "meant a lot to each other and we always will." She also didn't want to slam him too much in her book, saying, "I want to be very respectful because I married him for a reason and we were together for seven years for a reason."</p><p>She added, "He has a family now and I would never say anything to disrespect that."</p><p>Lachey is married to Vanessa Minnillo, with whom he shares three children.
