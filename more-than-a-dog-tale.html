<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>More Than A Dog Tale Laurel Mercantile</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Everybody on this planet loves a heartwarming animal story. These type<br>&nbsp;of stories are all over social media. I’ve tried, but it’s impossible to pass one by.<br>There’s so much horrible stuff in the news these days, I believe that most people<br>are simply searching for anything that will provide a bright spot, a little giggle, a<br>happy tear or a fond memory of a pet long gone.</p><p>&nbsp;This is much more than a dog story. Oh yes, it’s about Baker the GreatPyrenees who lives in the Historic District of Laurel with Erin and Ben Napier, mydaughter and son-in-law. If you work or live in downtown, you’ve probably seen<br>Baker (short for Studebaker) and his brother Chevy (short for Chevrolet) taking<br>Erin and Ben for their morning or afternoon walks. Baker’s day isn’t complete until<br>he goes for a refreshing swim in the fountain located in the park next to the<br>Arabian Theatre.</p><p>Baker is a rescue dog that still has some sad issues. He was pitiful when<br>they first saved him from the miserable life he had been living. His white fur was<br>matted, falling out, and crawling with fleas and ticks. He had sores that he had<br>scratched until they were bleeding. He was grossly underweight and scrounging<br>around in garbage cans hunting anything he could eat. People who mistreat and<br>neglect pets don’t deserve to have them. They actually deserve jail time—or<br>worse. I won’t disclose from where he was rescued, but it was a stealth operation<br>carried out under cover of darkness one morning right before the sun came up.<br>In the beginning, he was terribly skittish, crouching down every time a<br>human hand tried to show him affection. The first time it came a thunderstorm,<br>they were shocked to see that he laid down and played dead until it passed over.<br>Fireworks and thunder still send him into a panic where he either becomes<br>catatonic or tries to tear down the fence gate to escape from the noise. He freaked<br>out every time he had to ride in the back of Ben’s truck. He would froth at the<br>mouth and eventually throw up before he reached his destination. To avoid<br>inflicting further trauma, Erin and Ben started walking him the 4 or 5 blocks to see<br>the veterinarians at Sawmill Animal Hospital.</p><p>Last Thursday started out as a beautiful sunny day, so Ben decided to<br>leave the back garage door shut before heading to work. The garage is where<br>Baker seeks refuge when that awful thunder and lightening monster comes<br>calling.</p><p>Erin was neck-deep at work and didn’t realize a cloud had come up. Her<br>phone rang. It was chief of police Tyrone Stewart. Immediately, she feared<br>something horrible had happened to Ben.<br>“Erin, this is Tyrone. Is Baker at home?”<br>“Well, I think so...”<br>“Office Caraway is pretty sure she just saw him running down the<br>sidewalk near the Sawmill Animal Clinic, so she followed him right to the door and<br>they let him inside. He must have gotten scared of the weather. I don’t know if<br>they checked his tag, but we’re pretty sure it’s him.”</p><p>Before Erin could hang up with Chief Stewart, her daddy was beeping in.<br>Detective Kim Stewart had called him asking if Erin knew the whereabouts of<br>Baker.</p><p>Before she could hang up with her daddy, Sawmill Animal Hospital was<br>calling to tell her that Baker was safe and sound there.</p><p>Before she could finish the conversation with the vet’s office, Holly Green<br>from LRMA called to say she had found and secured brother Chevy into the<br>backyard, but Baker was nowhere in sight.</p><p>And so, Ben went to the vet to pick up their big scaredy pup, who was<br>just fine and no worse for the wear.</p><p>As Erin wrote in her blog that night, this is the wonderful thing about living<br>in a small town like Laurel. People care. People go out of their way to do the right<br>thing. Where everybody knows your name. And the names of your pets.&nbsp;There are such things as police escorts protecting traumatized neighborhood dogs trying to take themselves to the vet.</p><p>You gotta love a town like that.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/unnamed_cd3627dc-9dcc-4957-910e-a374207d1630.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><span>Karen Clark Rasberry, besides being Erin's mom, is an IPPY-award winning author and realtor in Laurel, Mississippi.
