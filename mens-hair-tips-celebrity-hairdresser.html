Go big when you blowdry</strong></h2><p id=eRJVs5CA3LIin data-wc=62>"When you are blowdrying your hair to style it, so many guys try to get it immediately to the style they've got in their head, which doesn't work. It will end up being too flat. When blowdrying your hair, always try to make it as big as possible, and then you can finish it with products to get it in to shape."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c0de130b88e3-dyson-supersonic-hair-dryer-mens-haircuts-z.jpg><p id=eIMAjXtqglZZE data-wc=5><strong>Dyson Supersonic Hair Dryer, £299.99, <span><a aria-label="mens hair styling products" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">Argos</a></span></strong></p><h6><span><a aria-label="mens hairstyling products" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">SHOP NOW</a></span></h6><h2><strong>4. It all starts with a clean scalp</strong></h2><p id=ezUiH9yjgvUPo data-wc=54>"A clean scalp is more important than having clean hair. A lot of guys think that if they wash their hair every day they're damaging it, but it's actually the build-up on your scalp that's probably damaging your hair. One of the problems of scalp build-up from product is that it thins the hair.</p><p id=eTwGKRtWV8Jwk data-wc=50>"All those clays and waxes sit on the scalp, solidify, which can actually constrict the hair follicles, so it's really important to make sure that's cleaned off properly. Men with short hair struggle with this more as the product gets much closer to the scalp than people with longer hair.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4a53529bd4e3-fudge-professional-clean-mint-deep-cleaning-shampoo-mens-haircuts-z.jpg><p id=e9BOJMdTJn78N data-wc=11><strong>Fudge Professional Clean Mint Deep Cleaning Shampoo, Was £14, now £11.15, <span><a aria-label="mens hair styling products" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">Beauty Bay</a></span></strong></p><h6><span><a aria-label="mens hairstyling products" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">SHOP NOW</a></span></h6><p id=ewa9Avz4Dr0zT data-wc=32>"This mint shampoo is a purifying shampoo, it's designed to cleanse the hair and purify the scalp at the same time. It gets rid of flakes, wax residue and things like that."</p><h2><strong>5. Less is more when it comes to product</strong></h2><p id=eJAXZXF4ELofw data-wc=61>"Nine times out of 10 from my personal experience, I find that men don't fully understand how to use products properly. They either spray it over the top of the head or just put all of their gel and wax through the front. By the time they've got enough on to keep their hair controlled, it just ends up being greasy.</p><p id=eUgkHd7TSsoHY data-wc=84>"What guys need to do is take a product to the back of the head, right by the crown. Use a little bit less than you think you need, put it in the middle of your hand and rub it in until it vanishes. Then start at the back around the crown and massage your scalp with the product. It puts the product inside rather than on the surface, and then you can style it however you want, and you stop it being greasy."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/aba5ca112eae-kevin-murphy-free-hold-mens-haircuts-z.jpg><p id=eXyo4_Q7J03h1 data-wc=5><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kevin Murphy Free Hold, £25, <span><a aria-label="mens hair styling products" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">Cult Beauty</a></span></strong></p><h6><span><a aria-label="mens hairstyling products" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">SHOP NOW</a></span></h6><p id=eVed50lAc7esH data-wc=43>"To keep it clean, use a comb to style, or for a messy look, just rough it up with your fingers. You'll use less, your hair will stay longer, and it will look more matte than you've ever been able to get it."</p><h2><strong>6. Use your hands</strong></h2><p id=e3gsZaV1rYTHk data-wc=53>"If you're struggling to get texture in a groomed swept-back look, or a quiff, the easiest thing to do is use your hand like a claw. Spray hairspray in between your fingers, rake your hands through your hair and separate it in between your fingers. You're left with great textured hair super quickly."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1242bf5ec3cf-ouai-texturising-hair-spray-mens-haircuts-z.jpg><p id=ejhEULfp4lALB data-wc=5><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Ouai Texturising Hair Spray, £10, <span><a aria-label="mens hair styling products" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">Cult Beauty</a></span></strong></p><h6><span><a aria-label="mens hairstyling products" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">SHOP NOW</a></span></h6><h2><strong>7. Curly hair tips for men, from diffusers to products</strong></h2><p id=eoyvmgnQvpCMH data-wc=32>"Guys with curly hair is a big trend – just look at <a class=hm-link href=#>Tom Holland</a> and <a class=hm-link href=#>Timothee Chalamet</a> – we're seeing so many people growing out their hair and pushing boundaries. I have a tip for this.</p><p id=eovVbu1K5VkQX data-wc=35>"Using a diffuser and nourishing products helps, but my biggest tip for curly hair that will actually make it last is to leave it a bit damp. Curly hair struggles more than other hair types.</p><p id=eEIKpdORCJdUE data-wc=39>"When your hair grows, your product naturally produces oil that is designed to condition the hair. If you colour your hair, your hair becomes damaged, so the oil doesn't stick. Curly hair is that same - it's more dry.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/305a54af875c-aveda-be-curly-curl-enhancer-mens-haircuts-z.jpg><p id=erGndVFLz-dEP data-wc=6>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Aveda Be Curly Curl Enhancer, £23.50, </strong><span><a aria-label="mens hair styling products" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">Space NK</a></span></p><h6><span><a aria-label="mens hairstyling products" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">SHOP NOW</a></span></h6><p id=eZvt3UEPTFX59 data-wc=62>"So if you dry your hair too much, and take all of the excess moisture out of it, it's like running a marathon without any water. If I offered you a glass of water at the end, you wouldn't sip it. So when curly hair is fully dried and then goes into humid conditions, it soaks up that moisture and gets frizzy."</p><h2><strong>8. Accentuate those features</strong></h2><p id=eLbDRzOPLKnOC data-wc=50>"If you want to define features of your hair, a wavy quiff or pushed back look, a great way to do this is to hold the hair in your fingers and dry it gently with a diffuser. You hold your hair where you want it to be and set it.</p><p id=eIlV5JjuaZjn6 data-wc=25>"You can spray hairspray into the diffuser so it dries in the hairdryer and just the hold will stick to your hair, stopping any crispiness.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6dc37d48f0a1-hairizone-universal-diffuser-for-hair-dryers-mens-haircuts-z.jpg><p id=eSYDnZ3iStq1w data-wc=7>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Hairizone Universal Diffuser for Hair Dryers, £25, <span><a aria-label="mens hair styling products" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">Amazon</a></span></strong></p><h6><span><a aria-label="mens hairstyling products" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">SHOP NOW</a></span></h6><p id=eD0wAjUr0rDep data-wc=21>"If you use a regular nozzle only do it for something super sleek, the diffuser spreads the air so it's softer."</p><h2><strong>9. Worried about thin hair? This is the best product for you</strong></h2><p id=eiHm-qQDihCHr data-wc=55>"For those with thinner hair, or men worrying about hair loss, try the <strong>Fudge Professional XXL hair thickener</strong> when your hair is wet. When you blowdry your hair, the heat actives a polymer in the product that swells and thickens your hair by 100%. As far as I'm aware, there's no other product like this."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/23fba190ffae-fudge-professional-styling-xxl-hair-thickener-cream-mens-haircuts-z.jpg><p id=ekHLvzmYg8upe data-wc=8>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Fudge Professional Styling XXL Hair Thickener Cream, £15, <span><a aria-label="mens hair styling products" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">LookFantastic</a></span></strong></p><h6><span><a aria-label="mens hairstyling products" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">SHOP NOW</a></span></h6><h2><strong>10. The easiest men's hair trick - hairspray!</strong></h2><p id=efttIQJ02j-Oz data-wc=47>"If blowdrying is not in your skillset, then my ultimate top tip is the no heat blow dry. Go through your normal shampoo and conditioner routine, then comb your hair into the shape that you want, so that it looks how you want it to end up.</p><p id=e9mXMO30VRwuI data-wc=36>"Once combed into shape, spray hairspray into it and then leave to air dry. Then gently brush it out.

Skull shape, lips, cheekbones and facial features all play a part in the perfect haircut</strong></h2><p id=ezOhvEcNQylrx data-wc=58>"Before gaining my big-name clients I saw a gap in the market for a tailor-made bespoke approach to men's hair cuts. Skull shape, lips, cheekbones and facial features all have to be considered when getting the perfect haircut. Just like a perfectly tailored suit works with your body dimensions, your hair should do the same with your face."</p><p id=eFUMy0CzUALac data-wc=53>"Don't get a haircut for a trend, take inspiration for a haircut from a trend.
