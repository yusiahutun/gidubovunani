The <a href=# title=_self>Fuller House</a> star has undeniably aged like fine wine and it hasn’t gone unnoticed by all of his die-hard fans. Ever since John returned to TV with starring roles on Grandfathered and the <a href=# title=_self>Full House</a> spin-off, Fuller House, many viewers have become more and more interested in the hunky actor’s personal life — and, particularly, his love life — and have asked, is John married?</p><p>The 54-year-old literally doesn’t age — that much the world can unanimously agree on. But when it comes to the wisdom he’s obtained over the years, the on-screen Uncle Jesse is undoubtedly full of insight, especially when it comes to love, children, and relationships. <strong>Scroll down to read fascinating facts about John!</strong></p><p></p><h2>Is John Stamos married?</h2><p>No, but he will be soon! After dating his <a href=#>girlfriend Caitlin McHugh</a>, a 31-year-old actress, for more than a year, John <a href=#>popped the question</a> in October 2017. “I asked… she said yes!… And we lived happily ever after,” John said of his romantic Disneyland proposal. Caitlin previously gushed of her soon-to-be hubby, “We like to keep our lives private because we’ve seen what relationships in the public eye can be like and we just like our privacy,” Caitlin previously told <a href=# title=_self>People</a>. “We’re very happy together and we hope to be so for a long time.”</p><p>John was previously married to actress and model Rebecca Romijn from 1998 until 2005, when the <a href=#>couple divorced</a>. For a while, fans thought that John was married to <a href=#>Lori Loughlin</a> because they are TV husband and wife, but they’re not a couple. Though he has previously revealed that he and his co-star Lori once dated a long time ago, he has since admitted that their timing has never been right.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/john-stamos-rebecca-romijn.jpg><p>John and Rebecca.</p><p>“[We] went on a date to Disneyland before, you know, before we were both married. In real life, when we were 18, 19 years old,” he once revealed on <a href=# title=_self>Huff Post Live</a>. “We did have some off timing, but no disrespect to her family and her husband now, I would say that she could be the one that got away.”</p><h2>Does John Stamos have kids?</h2><p>Not yet, but he and his fianceé Caitlin are <a href=#>now expecting!</a> “I’ll be a fun dad. I’ve been practicing for a long time. I’ve done every schtick you can do with a baby on TV… all the bits and jokes and diaper gags. I’ll probably just do all that stuff,” John said after announcing the news on Wednesday, Dec. 13. In a previous interview, John gushed he couldn’t wait to become a first-time dad. “My ovaries are rattling,” he <a href=#>joked</a> in 2015. “Do men have ovaries? They’re jingling. I can hear them jingling now.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/john-stamos-caitlin-mchugh.jpg><p>John and Caitlin.</p><h2>Who has John Stamos dated?</h2><p>John has a pretty well-documented <a href=#>dating history</a>.
