(The pharmacy will then bill Medicare. Medicare will reimburse pharmacies up to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">$12 for each COVID test</a>, or $24 for a two-test kit).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How can I get free COVID-19 tests if I don’t have Medicare?</h2><p>If you are under 65 and don’t have Medicare, you can order free at-home <a href=#>COVID-19 testing</a> kits from your insurance company. The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Biden Administration</a> has required private health insurance companies to cover at-home kits for free since January 15 of this year.</p><p>Your insurance may allow you to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">pick up free tests from a pharmacy</a> by simply presenting your health insurance card. Or you may be required to pay up front and get reimbursed later (keep that receipt!), depending on your insurer’s policy. Call your insurance provider to learn the details.</p><p>Also, you can now get an additional four free tests (delivered to your home) by following the instructions at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">covid.gov/tests</a> or calling 1-800-232-0233&nbsp;(TTY&nbsp;1-888-720-7489). If you have yet to order your first round, you can still do so.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfpby0wNJon56ZnKm1brrEsKponqKasm6vzq%2BgnWVhbnq1sdKtqg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./daisy-may-cooper-teases-shock-twists-am-i-being-unreasonable-season-two.html><span>←</span><span>Daisy May Cooper reveals shock twists ahead for Am I Being Unreasonable season two</span></a>
