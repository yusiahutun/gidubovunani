But when the entertainment giant shared that Halle Bailey would play the titular mermaid, Ariel, some people weren't happy with the fact that a Black actress would be taking on the role.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bailey said that she expected that reaction all along, knowing that as a Black entertainer, she would face challenges like racism as she navigated her career. Thankfully, she had some advice from none other than Beyoncé, and she noted that attendees at D23, Disney's convention for die-hard fans, celebrated alongside her.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"As a Black person, you just expect it and it's not really a shock anymore," Bailey said in a new interview with&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Face</a>. ​"When [Chlöe and I] first signed to Parkwood, [Beyoncé] was always like: ​'I never read my comments. Don't ever read the comments.' Honestly, when the teaser came out, I was at the D23 Expo and I was so happy. I didn't see any of the negativity."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Disney Enterprises, Inc.</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I know people are like: ​'It's not about race.' But now that I'm her… People don't understand that when you're Black there's this whole other community," Bailey continued. "It's so important for us to see ourselves."<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Even though there was a contingent of critics, Bailey said that as certain reaction videos went viral online, she saw that the casting meant a lot to Black children and that support meant the world to her.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I was crying all night for two days, just staring at them in disbelief," the actress said of seeing the clips. ​"It makes me feel more grateful for where I am."<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Director Rob Marshall told&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Entertainment Weekly</a>&nbsp;that he saw Ariel as "a very modern woman, someone who sees her life differently than anyone around her, and goes to find that dream." He went on to say that there was "no agenda" to casting Ariel in his remake.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We just were looking for the best actor for the role, period. The end," he said. "We saw everybody and every ethnicity."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"With Rob, he's so amazing and just saying, 'I see you and I want to bring you into the character,'" Bailey said during an interview at D23 in 2022. "So, it was a beautiful thing. My hair, for example — incorporating my locs into the red hair was something that was really special to me. The outfit, the fins, everything. It's just amazing. I'm just grateful that I've been able to take the essence of me and mix the two."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Little Mermaid&nbsp;arrives in theaters on May 26.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57x5qjpZ1dl66quMSyZJ6woJqwtbHDZqmam5mowW6vzqaknqakqHqttdOto55lnZq%2Frq3InWScmaOptq%2BzjHBoamtgboE%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./christina-applegate-hollywood-home-inside.html><span>←</span><span>Dead to Me star Christina Applegate's ultra private Hollywood home amid MS diagnosis</span></a>
