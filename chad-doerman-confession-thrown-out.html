Shut the door so I don't f--king kill him," after placing him a cruiser. The judge ruled it was "unlikely" Doerman actually heard those comments, however, as the air conditioning inside the cruiser had been turned up and the deputy was a good distance from the car when he said them.</p><p>The judge also said there was no evidence detectives used coercive tactics during the subsequent interrogation either, including Detective Ross allegedly comparing Doerman to a "monster" during the conversation.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Doerman has pleaded not guilty</strong></a> to 21 charges facing him.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:db654ac6-545b-4fd9-b892-7c190d882b59 data-container-ref=toofab:article:efdf45f0-817b-4dc5-bfc2-8500472d8ff0 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/05/5by4/2023/06/30/05a216624ae548cb8855124944786b97_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Law&Crime</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">New Bodycam Footage Shows Behavior of Father Arrested for Killing Three Sons Just After Arrest</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>Warning: The allegations below are extremely disturbing.</strong></p><p>According to a bill of particulars filed by prosecutors laying out the allegations against the suspect (via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>FOX19</strong></a>), the attack happened after Doerman returned home early from work and had his wife and sons "join him in the master bedroom for a nap." At some point, he allegedly got out of bed, loaded a rifle and shot son Hunter twice. Though his stepdaughter was watching TV in another room during the nap, authorities say she "witnessed the shooting."</p><p>According to the report, the boys' sister saw Doerman chase after one of the children who made a run for it toward a nearby field -- Clayton, 7 -- shooting him and causing him to fall to the ground. Doerman then allegedly shot the child in the head, "at close range."</p><p>As this happened, the young girl is said to have ran back inside the home and picked up the youngest boy, Chase, before she "attempted to flee the residence with him." Doerman, however, allegedly caught up to her, held her at gunpoint and "demanded" she put down the child, which she did as she "begged" him not to shoot her. Doerman allegedly shot at Chase, but his gun didn't fire, so the child ran to his mother. The sister, meanwhile, ran to the fire department and <a href=#><strong>told witnesses her father was "killing everyone."</strong></a></p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:139862da-746b-46f0-93fc-1b2bbeeed72e data-container-ref=toofab:article:efdf45f0-817b-4dc5-bfc2-8500472d8ff0 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/b2/5by4/2023/06/23/b2a7be24938249089b13875ccd6fb09b_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Rachel Brown/Facebook/WCPO</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Disturbing Details Revealed In Murders of 3 Ohio Boys as Dad Accused of Killing Them Pleads Not Guilty</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>The two parents then got into a "physical altercation," with Doerman reportedly "going so far as to bite" his wife to get her to drop Chase, per investigators. During the altercation, she is said to have placed her thumb over the barrel of the gun and was shot, causing her to drop the child. Doerman is accused of then fatally shooting the third son, before laying all three boys in the same area on the side of the home.</p><p>According to the docs, he then "sat on the side stoop of the residence and calmly watched [the wife] undertake futile live-saving measures on her three children," who all died from their injuries.</p><p>The docs also claim Doerman told authorities, "I did it. Take me to jail" and said "I shouldn't have done that." They also claim he "admitted to having been thinking about shooting his sons since October" and indicated "that the thoughts of having to kill his sons was so heavy on him that he hadn't slept for three or four days prior" to the murders.</p><p>His trial is set for July.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:b9d0e147-b164-4149-b2c9-af1ac993280a data-container-ref=toofab:article:efdf45f0-817b-4dc5-bfc2-8500472d8ff0 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/ab/5by4/2023/06/19/abcacdf4e922436eb6c0d9e7fc650643_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Clermont County Sheriff’s Office</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Chilling Bodycam Video Shows Arrest of Father Charged with Lining Up and Killing 3 Sons Aged 3, 4 and 7</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:8e6c0854-cf7a-4409-ab63-24b0456c238b data-container-ref=toofab:article:efdf45f0-817b-4dc5-bfc2-8500472d8ff0 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/64/5by4/2023/06/22/6471d607e55446da9391789c3e258db1_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Clermont County Sheriff’s Office</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Frantic 911 Calls Released Over Ohio Father Charged with Killing Three Sons Aged 3, 4 and 7</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j2xmanBfmLWisIydpp6qnZa7bq%2FOp52eq6OevK9506GpqK%2BeYry2wI4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./downton-abbey-star-joanne-froggatt-turns-ill-fitting-stilettos-wedges-html.html><span>←</span><span>Downton Abbey star Joanne Froggatt turns ill-fitting stilettos into wedges</span></a>
