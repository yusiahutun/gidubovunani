Kim Woolery, who is a hairstylist by profession, also became fodder for paparazzi when she became the fourth wife of American game show host Chuck Woolery.</h3><h2>Wife of Veteran Talk Show Host Chuck Woolery</h2><p>It is said, 'Age is just a number.' This statement is so true in the case of Kim Woolery. She is married to <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Chuck Woolery</a></strong>, who is twenty-five years senior to her. Michigan native and her future husband met in 2003 on a blind date. Though the pair had a huge age gap between them, nonetheless, sparks flew between them, and the couple started dating.</p><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2020/01/20/chuck-woolery-and-his-wife-kim-woolery-on-their-wedding-day--1579517581.jpg width=450 height=337 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><strong><span class=imageCaption>Kim Woolery on her wedding day. </span><span class=imageSource>SOURCE: The Cave of Pythia</span></strong><p>After a courtship of more than two years, the lovebirds tied the knot in July 2006. The wedding took place at the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas in the presence of close friends and family. For the big day, the bride wore a halter neck off the white color dress, and the groom selected a classic black suit with a white shirt.</p><p>It has been six years since Kim exchanged vows with Chuck. Thankfully there is no news of trouble in their household. The pair is still enjoying marital bliss without any rumors of divorce.</p><h3>Past Affairs of Chuck Woolery</h3><p>Kim came into the limelight only after she started a relationship with Chuck, so different aspects of her life before meeting him are not known in the media. Also, even after becoming a celebrity wife, she kept a low profile; thus, her personal life is still a mystery, including her love life.</p><p>On the other hand, Chuck, for most of his life, always remained in the media. He was on the news because of work or his marriages. It is very public knowledge that Chuck is a thrice divorcee.</p><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2020/01/20/chuck-woolery-second-wife-is-actress-jo-ann-pflug--1579518028.jpg width=450 height=350 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><strong>Kim's husband, Chuck, was married to<span class=imageCaption>&nbsp;actress Jo Ann Pflug. </span><span class=imageSource>SOURCE: Getty Images</span></strong><p>The original host of "Wheel of Fortune"&nbsp; first marriage was with <strong>Margaret Hayes,</strong> and it lasted for nearly a decade.

His third marriage was with <strong>Teri Nelson,</strong> which lasted for more than fifteen years.</p><h3>Children of Chuck Woolery</h3><p>Kim does not share any children with her husband, Chuck. The reason is that her life partner was way past his fertile years when they wed. On the other hand, Chuck has four children from his past three marriages.</p><p>Speaking of which, Kim is a stepmother to <strong>Katherine Woolery</strong>, <strong>Melissa Woolery</strong>, <strong>Michael Woolery</strong>, and <strong>Sean Woolery</strong>. Kim would also be a stepmother to <strong>Chad Woolery</strong> who unfortunately died in 1986 in a bike accident.</p><p>Both Melissa and Chad are the children of Chuck and his first wife Margaret Hayes. Likewise, Melissa is the daughter Chuck shares with his second wife, actress Jo Ann Pflug. As for Sean and Michael, they are the son of <strong>Teri Nelson</strong> who was the adopted daughter of <strong>David Oswald Nelson</strong>.</p><h2>What is Mrs. Woolery's Profsssion and her Net Worth</h2><p>Kim Woolery is a hairstylist by profession and is credited in the movie, "The Last Word" and show "Deal or No Deal." However, after marriage, she moved to Texas with her husband and stopped actively working. So, as of 2020, her net worth is estimated to be around $<strong>100,000</strong>.</p><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2020/01/20/chuck-woolery-was-the-original-host-of-wheel-of-fortune--1579517741.jpg width=450 height=562 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><strong><span class=imageCaption>Chuck Woolery was the host of 'Wheel of Fortune.' </span><span class=imageSource>SOURCE: Wheel of Fortune History Wiki-Fandom</span></strong><p>On the other hand, Kim's spouse Chuck Woolery is a veteran game show host with shows such as "Wheel of Fortune," "Love Connection," and "Scrabble." under his credits. Also, he is a host of the podcast Blunt Force Truth. As of 2020, he boasts an overall net worth of <strong>$15 million</strong>.</p><h3>Based in Texas</h3><p>When her then-fiance Chuck informed her he has bought a property in Texas and planned to move there in the future, she was not excited. She, after all, had a career in California and wanted to pursue it even after nuptials.</p><p>However, her husband had some other plans. He wanted to fulfill his childhood dream of enjoying fishing from the comfort of his own house, which was available on his Texas house, which has its private dock. Thus, he convinced his wife to move to Texas by promising that they will go back and forth between Texas and their house in Venice, California.</p><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2020/01/20/chuck-woolery-resides-in-texas-to-enjoy-fishing--1579517864.jpg width=450 height=269 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><strong>Kim<span class=imageCaption> Woolery's husband is enjoying fishing from their private dock in Texas. </span><span class=imageSource>SOURCE: Collective Vision-Austin American-Statesman</span></strong><p>Sadly, Chuck didn't keep his promise. As soon as they moved to their new house in Texas, he sold their house in Venice. Kim, at first, was a bit upset with his decision; however, after getting a taste of Southern hospitality, she warmed up with the idea.</p><p>So, what did Texas do that impressed Kim? Well, soon after she moved to her new house, she had an emergency gall bladder surgery. While in the hospital, the Nurse and other staff took such good care.</p><p>She was overwhelmed by their attention. Thus she thought to leave such good people with kind hearts will be foolishness; therefore, she decided to make Texas their permanent abode.</p><p><strong>Visit <a href=# rel=noopener>Marriedwiki</a> for more celebrity <a href=# rel=noopener>Biographies</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Articles</a>!!!</strong></p><ul><li><a href=#>#celebrity married</a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDsKCkoV6YvK571qKiomebnrpuw86oo56qqQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brent-musburger-wife-children-family-fired-retiring-net-worth-bio-html.html><span>←</span><span>Brent Musburger Wife, Children, Family, Fired, Retiring, Net Worth, Bio</span></a>
