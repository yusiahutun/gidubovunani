The New Zealand actor was left “practically concussed” after a stunt he decided to do himself went terribly wrong.</p><p>Although the Grey’s Anatomy actor is all fine now, he’s already said that he will never do any stunts himself in the future. Today, we are going to have a look at his relationship status — how many kids he has and whether or not he is still together with lifestyle blogger and travel junkie <a href=#>Aisha Mendez</a>.</p><h3><strong>Martin Henderson Relationship Status: Is He Still With Aisha Mendez?</strong></h3><p>Everyone who follows Martin Henderson on social media knows that the actor does not shy away from his love life publicly. But, lately, Martin has only uploaded pictures from his professional life — like movie premieres and stuff. Does that mean he has already broken up with his quarantine love?</p><p>Martin and Aisha began dating during the 2020 COVID-19 lockdowns and were even quarantined together. He first teased a picture of Aisha Mendez to his fans and followers on April 29, 2020. The uploaded picture was of Aisha’s cropped back clicked while she was enjoying the beautiful scenery of Baja.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gossipnextdoor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Martin-Henderson1-263x300.png><p>The couple also went Instagram official during the quarantine period. The adorable duo featured each other a lot of times on social media, and Martin often praised his lady’s sense of humor too.</p><p>However, it looks like their lockdown bond was not too strong to keep them together. As per Country Living, Martin and Aisha broke up in early 2022.</p><p>Since then, The Ring actor has deleted all of his and Aisha’s pictures from his Instagram account.</p><p>In case you did not know, Martin Henderson previously dated G.I. Jane actress Demi Moore. In 2012, paparazzi captured Martin cozying up with Demi Moore, following her divorce from That ’70s Show star Ashton Kutcher, as they went grocery shopping and lunching together in New Preston, Connecticut. Although Martin did not react to the news at that time, in 2014, he told the Sunday Herald Sun it was not fun having their move tracked. He also shared that he felt for Demi.</p><p>Martin is currently romancing Alexandra Breckenridge on screen. Leaving Grey’s Anatomy in 2017, Martin landed the main role of Jack Sheridan, a bar owner, and love interest for protagonist Melinda “Mel” Monroe, played by This Is Us actress Alexandra Breckenridge, in the Netflix show Virgin River.</p><p>Talking about his on-screen chemistry with This Is Us actress Alexandra Breckenridge, Martin said, “We’re blessed with the fact that Alex and I have good chemistry. That’s really evident, and it’s not something you can always count on, unfortunately. It’s either there, or it’s not, and we have it, so it allows us to work in a way that is respectful of one another,” to TV Line in 2020.</p><p>While the duo has an undeniably good on-screen chemistry, they never dated each other. In fact, Alexandra married Katy Perry’s drummer Casey Hooper in 2015. They shared two kids together, a four-year-old son named Jack and a three-year-old daughter, Billie.</p><h3><strong>Does Martin Henderson Have Children?</strong></h3><p>Although Martin Henderson has dated many women over the years, he never really married anyone. As of this writing, he also did not have any children.</p><p>That being said, Martin does have a handful of little nephews and one cute dog named Sammy, who all are no less than kids for him.</p><p>On July 17, 2018, Martin uploaded a picture with his three nephews while “monkeying around” on “Mother Maui.”</p><p>Martin also often shares pictures of his puppy on his Instagram. In a recent post, he shared a close-up shot of his doggy on the beach and gushed: ‘I love him so much. Even when he gets coated in fine sand and leaves it ALL over the boat.’</p><h3><strong>Martin Henderson Young</strong></h3><p>Martin Henderson does not look much different when compared to his young photos. Except for some gray hair and beard and maybe some wrinkles on the face, Martin looks the same now as he looked in the 90s (while playing the 1995 TV series Echo Point).</p><h3><strong>Martin Henderson Net Worth</strong></h3><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, Martin Henderson’s net worth was estimated to be around $6 million as of 2022.</p><p>Born in Auckland, New Zealand, Martin began acting when he was 13, kicking off his career with a local TV production named Strangers.</p><p>Since then, Martin has landed roles in many popular movies and TV series, like Kick, The Ring, Little Fish, Bride and Prejudice, Shortland Street, Grey’s Anatomy, and Virgin River, among others, and has bagged a handful of awards.</p><p>Martin received his education at Westlake High School and Birkenhead Primary Northcote Intermediate. He trained himself as an actor at Neighborhood Playhouse in New York.</p><h3><strong>Who Are Martin Henderson Parents?</strong></h3><p>Martin Henderson’s parents are Ian Henderson (father) and Veronica Henderson (mother). Although Martin has not featured his parents on Instagram lately, he once featured both of them in an IG post and thanked Bill for an awesome espresso at Holy Spirit Espresso.</p><p>The Virgin River actress also has a brother in his family.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>How Old Is Martin Henderson?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Born on October 8, 1974, Martin Henderson was 47 years old as of this writing.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>How Tall Is Martin Henderson?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Actor Martin Henderson stands tall at a height of 5 feet 9 inches and weighs exactly 70 kilograms.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Is Martin Henderson On Instagram?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Martin Henderson is on Instagram <a href=#>@martinhendersonofficial</a>, where he had exactly 1 million followers in July 2022.</p><p>Recently, the New Zealand actor urged his Instagram followers to remain wary of scammers posing as him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmppmiqbaveceepZ2doqi8r3nRnqOarJmku7S0yKlkrKyRqcK0edKtoKWkXay2tbSMmqCsoJFk</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmartin-henderson-relationship-status-still-with-aisha.html&text=Is%20He%20Still%20With%20Aisha%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmartin-henderson-relationship-status-still-with-aisha.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmartin-henderson-relationship-status-still-with-aisha.html&title=Is%20He%20Still%20With%20Aisha%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmartin-henderson-relationship-status-still-with-aisha.html&title=Is%20He%20Still%20With%20Aisha%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmartin-henderson-relationship-status-still-with-aisha.html&title=Is%20He%20Still%20With%20Aisha%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmartin-henderson-relationship-status-still-with-aisha.html&description=Is%20He%20Still%20With%20Aisha%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-10-best-minecraft-sex-mods.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The 10 best Minecraft sex mods">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./justin-bieber-usher-halftime-show-report-rumor.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Will Justin Bieber Join Usher for Halftime Show?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
