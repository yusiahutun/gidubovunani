Regardless of your needs or priorities, there's an AI code assistant for you.</p><h2 id=replit-rsquo-s-ghostwriter>1. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Replit’s Ghostwriter</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ghostwriter-homepage-screenshot.jpg><p>Ghostwriter is an AI-powered code completion tool built into the Replit IDE. It uses <a href=#>OpenAI's Codex</a> to generate code suggestions based on your current code, cursor position, and project context.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ghostwriter can help you code at the speed of thought. It can also help you write better code by suggesting more idiomatic code that's consistent with your project's style guide.</p><p>Ghostwriter supports various <a href=#>programming languages</a>, including Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, and Go. It offers many features, including code suggestion, code autocompletion, code generation, semantic search, and code explanation.</p><p>Unlike GitHub Copilot, that’s available on many IDEs, GhostWriter is only available on the Replit IDE.</p><p>Ghostwriter is an excellent alternative to Copilot if you use Replit often. Access to Ghostwriter is expensive compared to GitHub Copilot since you must pay for Replit’s Pro plan. Paying for Replit also gives you full access to Replit’s AI mode and other paid Replit features.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tabnine>2. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TabNine</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tabnine-s-hompepage-screenshot.jpg><p>TabNine is an AI code assistant that helps you write code faster and better. It provides intelligent code completion, syntax highlighting, and error checking for various programming languages.</p><p>TabNine analyzes existing code to suggest words or phrases to predict later ones. It can also offer entire lines of code, functions, and classes. TabNine's model learns from a massive open-source dataset to suggest code relevant to your project.</p><p>A strong advantage of TabNine is its free plan for personal projects. They also offer a paid pro plan with features like hosting and training your AI models.</p><p>TabNine is a great GitHub Copilot alternative since you can connect its AI models to your code repositories.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=codegeex>3. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CodeGeex</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/codegeex-hompepage-screenshot-png.jpg><p>CodeGeex is an AI-powered code assistant that can help you write code faster.</p><p>Its model learns from a massive dataset of code.

The suggestions aren’t AI generated but based on real-world code by other developers, making them more likely to be accurate and useful.</p><p>Captain Stack supports many languages, including JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, C++, and C#. It also supports a variety of popular frameworks, such as React, Angular, and Vue.</p><p>Another advantage of Captain Stack over Copilot is that it is free and open-source.
