Their mission? To inspire gay people to attend the second Black Panther–organized Revolutionary People’s Constitutional Convention in Washington, D.C., where they would join other liberationists from all around the country in writing a new American constitution.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Together, they spent six weeks on the road—Diana Ross and Mick Jagger on the radio, freedom and fear in the air. Joel was the radical; Richard, the lover; Giles, the organizer; Jimmy, the enfant terrible; and Doug, the cipher.</p><img alt="gay liberation" title="Gay Liberation" width=608 height=644 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/image004-1623077627.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Richard Koob</span><p>Clockwise from left: Joel, Richard, Doug, and Ben</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Before they even got underway, the government was watching them, worried about “a connection between the homosexual movement and the Black Panther Party,” a federal document shows.<br></p><img alt="fbi, one archives at the usc libraries" title="FBI, ONE Archives at the USC Libraries" width=1365 height=1800 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/image003-1623088753.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">ONE Archives at the USC Libraries</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The FBI was sowing discord among radicals, and it was easy for mistrust to take root. Once, these guys were lovers and comrades; now, some of them can’t even be in a Zoom with one another. But briefly, in the autumn of 1970, they saw a chance for a revolutionary future, and they struck out for it together.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Doug died of AIDS-related lymphoma in ’93, and I was never able to agree to the terms Jimmy set for an on-record interview, but Joel, Richard, and Giles were eager to share their memories.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Fifty years later, their stories are a patchwork quilt of collectives, communes, free love, coming out, getting arrested, consciousness-raising rap sessions, gun shooting, acid dropping, and trying to be macrobiotic at McDonald’s. Their versions vary widely, and reality lives somewhere unlocatable in the blurry overlap.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Once, these guys were lovers and comrades; now, some of them can’t even be in a Zoom together<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As a historian, I’m used to making the pieces fit, but it’s always something of a guess. Sometimes, the fragmentation is the story. Sometimes, the pieces are all we have. We’re told hindsight is twenty-twenty, but frankly, that’s bullshit. We’re fallible now, we were fallible then, and we’ll be fallible again tomorrow.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But that shouldn’t stop us from climbing mountains.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Joel:</strong> Okay, for my part, this is my story. There were five of us living in a collective together on the Lower East Side of New York, on 7th Street and Avenue C. Richard, Jimmy, myself, Giles—who else? Doug. Doug and I were the only two Black men in that collective. We were full-fledged Gay Liberation and Black Liberation and everything else people.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Giles:</strong> Richard was bar none the best-looking man in Gay Liberation. And Joel was the greatest dance partner I ever had. We would get up there in front of everybody and do the dirty bump as if it was propaganda.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Richard:</strong> I was living with Doug and Joel in a ménage à trois, and that was really wonderful.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">We couldn’t get regular jobs—everybody asked what our draft status was. [Instead], I had this International Rubdown service. We advertised in the Village Voice, $20 a rub. Because it was “International,” we had different names. I was Hans, the German, and Thor, the Swede.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I was also working with this underground printing press, printing stuff for the Black Panthers, the Young Lords, etc. And Jimmy owned a van, like a VW caravan, and he started talking about this trip. I don’t remember anything about bringing people to the Panther convention. But Jimmy recruited us. We were on for the ride and for the adventure.</p><img alt="gay pride parade" title="Gay Pride Parade" width=3483 height=5221 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/view-along-6th-avenue-as-hundreds-of-people-march-towards-news-photo-1623093078.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Allan Tannenbaum</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Giles:</strong> Jimmy had been involved with the Panthers. And I was knowledgeable about the underground press, so I’d call ahead to these newspapers, and say, “We're coming on a tour organizing for the Black Panthers’ Revolutionary Constitutional Convention. Do you know any gay people?”</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>We would get up there in front of everybody and do the dirty bump as if it was propaganda.<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Joel:</strong> We went from Fayetteville, [North Carolina], to New Orleans, to Dallas, to Boulder, Colorado, to Iona, Minnesota. We would contact Gay Liberation in each area, and they’d invite us to speak about what we were doing.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Living a revolutionary life, to me, is always questioning, always questioning myself, and questioning other people about what it is they know. It was a way of living. It was just … who we were. There was no thrill in wanting to have a revolution. Who wants to go through that? Unless you have to.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But I wasn’t scared or anything like that. I never felt scared—well, no, the only time I was scared was in Dallas, when we got arrested.</p><h2 data-node-id=25 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>Life on the Road</strong></h2><img alt="mcdonald's restaurant" title="McDonald's Restaurant" width=3000 height=2006 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/the-exterior-of-a-mcdonalds-fast-food-restaurant-is-shown-news-photo-1623092186.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Hulton Archive</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Richard:</strong> Who drove? I think we alternated. Doug and Joel and I, we were sharing clothes and living that way, very much sharing everything, cooking together, figuring out how to be macrobiotic. We’d stop at fast-food places because sometimes, that was the only food that we could afford and the only thing along the highway in the middle of America.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Giles: </strong>We might've had one pair of jeans, maybe one pair of cutoffs, and a couple of shirts each. Maybe a winter coat. None of us had a lot of clothing. We were proselytizing, so when we’d meet people, we’d sit on the floor in a circle, or in chairs, and spread the word about Gay Liberation.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Joel:</strong> The conversations were basically around what it was we were feeling as gay men and how we could move people to come to this convention so that we could organize ourselves.</p><h2 data-node-id=30 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>First Stop: North Carolina</strong></h2><img alt="liggett myers tobacco company building, greenville, nc" title="Liggett Myers Tobacco Company building, Greenville, NC" width=594 height=400 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/liggett-myers-tobacco-company-building-greenville-nc-news-photo-1623092307.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Joe Sohm/Visions of America</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Giles: </strong>Greenville, North Carolina, was one of the first places we stopped, because it was a center of leftist organizing in the textile mills. And there was a lot of Klan activity too. We’d made a kind of ideological decision: We have to come out to our parents. Doug’s family were country people, outside Greenville, and he told his mother that he was gay, and she was obviously stricken.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Richard:</strong> What happened with Doug and his family, as well as with me and my family later, was about beautiful Southern and Midwestern hospitality.

I mean, we didn’t spend very much money, because we didn’t have very much money! They were mostly young, white, gay men that were involved in Gay Liberation. Occasionally, we would see Black men. But there was a clear separation of Black and white communities, which is still a problem.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Giles:</strong> We made contact with this gay man who had a shelter in the French Quarter for gay adolescents who had been thrown out by their families. It was a little bit sketchy, and maybe exploitative. I remember being charmed by it, but also [thinking] that this place was certainly not glamorous at all. We did all the classic things, having beignets and coffee. Then, from New Orleans, we drove possibly to … Dallas?</p><h2 data-node-id=40 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>Texas</strong></h2><img alt="downtown fort worth" title="Downtown Fort Worth" width=1024 height=679 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/views-of-the-city-skyline-see-note-news-photo-1623092762.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Bettmann</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=42 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Joel:</strong> As soon as we entered Dallas, honey, they pulled us over. Well, I won’t get into the details of why. I’ll let other people talk about that. But it had nothing to do with anything other than that we were two Black men in that car with those white boys. We had sworn before we left New York that there were no drugs in the car ever. That was a rule that we all decided that we were going to follow.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=43 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Richard:</strong> Just around the freeway into Dallas, some big construction truck tried to force us off the highway. Then we were busted, because we were Black and white people together, looking like hippies, in a VW van. Pot was the only thing we had, and fortunately, I stashed it under the seat and the cops didn’t find it.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Living a revolutionary life is always questioning myself and questioning other people<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=45 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Giles:</strong> We didn't have any weed on the trip. We weren't smoking weed. The two rookie cops immediately searched Jimmy and found four tabs of acid in his jacket.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=46 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Richard: </strong>We were all held in a jail compound with lots of other people and had to hang through it for three nights. There must have been like maybe 20 other people in the cell. You were asking about a lesson from all this? Lesson number one was I do not want to go to jail.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=47 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Joel:</strong> I thought I was in jail for life because first of all, it was in the South. I don’t like going to the South, because I had done that as a child with my parents and it was horrible. Horrible experience to have to deal with. For a young Black child to have to witness his parents go through the shit that they had to go through just to get to Mississippi. … I never thought we’d get out of that jail.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=48 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Giles: </strong>Jimmy was prancing around in the holding cell in leather pants with snakeskin boots on, flipping his long blond curls. And Joel, who had been in jail, and I, who had been in jail, said, "Jim, come over here, sit the fuck down, and stop attracting potentially violent attention!"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=49 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Richard:</strong> Jimmy’s lawyer got us out in three days.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=50 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Joel:</strong> We were out before we knew it.

I called my parents in Shreveport, [Louisiana], after. They were terrified that I’d become a mad bomber. So I started the call by announcing that I was gay, and on a tour to recruit gay people for Gay Lib. My father burst into hysterical laughter—because what he had suspected was finally confirmed—but most of all, they were simply deeply relieved that I wasn’t a bomber.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=53 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">My 21-year-old lesbian sister was listening to the call. She was there with her first girlfriend, whom she had met through my mother. It was her first direct knowledge that I was gay, and that there was such a thing as Gay Liberation.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=54 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">They proceeded to have a wildly joyous and drunken party in celebration.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=55 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Joel:</strong> I was furious with Jimmy.

I contacted two friends of mine, Cecil and John, who were my first gay friends as an adult. In the previous four years, Cecil had grown, and he was the most godlike man I have ever seen in my life. He wanted to come to the convention. There was no reason in the world why he shouldn't have come along on that trip, but he didn't. The nasty part of me lays it on Jimmy and Richard, in particular, who were the ones driving. They didn't want to take on any of the sexual tension. They said no.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=77 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Richard:</strong> I think we did go to Louisville.

Inspired by this idea, 5,000 revolutionaries joined them in Washington. Government interference, internal strife among the Panthers, and external divisions between the invited groups prevented the constitution from ever being finished. But as Huey P. Newton, a Panther cofounder, once wrote, “[Revolution] is not a particular action, nor is it a conclusion. It is a process.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=85 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The dreams of the radical Seventies never failed; they are simply still unfinished.</p><h2 data-node-id=86 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>Afterward</strong></h2><img alt="the revolutionary people's constitional convention" title="The Revolutionary People's Constitional Convention" width=3500 height=2328 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/attendees-of-the-revolutionary-peoples-constitutional-news-photo-1623090724.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">David Fenton</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=88 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Joel:</strong> So we go back to New York.
