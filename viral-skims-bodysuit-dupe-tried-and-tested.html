Just throw on jeans or a skirt and you have the perfect base for an outfit. Since I’ve been known to shop SKIMS, especially when <a class=hm-link href=#>the hottest pieces are discounted in the SKIMS sale</a>, I can understand why the brand's looks are so popular. But not everyone is a fan - or has a bodysuit budget to splash out on the more expensive SKIMS bodysuits.</p><p id=etpKfdfNf4U data-wc=45>That could be why this versatile <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopener nofollow">Amazon bodysuit by Reoria (£19.99</a></span> / <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopener nofollow">$19.99</a></span>) with clever built-in support has gone viral: it's so similar to the Kim Kardashian brand's top selling <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopener nofollow">Fits Everybody High Neck Bodysuit ($60 / £60)</a></span> but with a much lower price tag.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b69d0091480e-amazon-reoria-skims-bodysuit-lookalike-review.jpg><p id=e_XXHHO70I data-wc=32>Plus, the Reoria suit comes in more colours than the Skims' 14 colourways – and it’s earning solid ratings. So I bought one to find out what all the fuss is about.</p><a href=# class=buttonWidgetButtonLink_b94rpwz rel="sponsored nofollow"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5743a23a7efc-viral-skims-dupe-bodysuit-on-amazon-z.jpg></a><p>REORIA Women's Sexy Sleeveless Racer Back Halter Neck Bodysuit, 20+ colours, Sizes XS - XXL<br></p><a href=# class="buttonWidgetButton_b1lxbopb buttonClass_by57jsl -primary" rel="sponsored nofollow"><p>£19.99 on Amazon UK</p></a><a href=# class="buttonWidgetButton_b1lxbopb buttonClass_by57jsl -primary" rel="sponsored nofollow"><p>$19.99 at Amazon US</p></a><p id=eMvbaEjzagk data-wc=46>So since I was looking for an alternative to try, the Amazon bodysuit on paper was the perfect choice.

The bodysuit felt weightier than I expected, with soft, double layered fabric, and, although my expectations were low, I thought it was surprisingly well made, with no loose stitches, or uneven seams.</p><p id=evm_d5pEiMO data-wc=61>Putting the bodysuit on for the first time, my biggest curiosity was whether, as someone with a bigger bust, I could wear this affordable bodysuit without a bra, as Amazon reviewers had claimed. Short answer: shockingly, yes. The longer answer is: yes, but on a cold day I’d probably look like I was rocking one of Kim Kardashian’s SKIMS nipple bras.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/99f04fbef925-amazon-reoria-bodysuit-worn-in-real-life.jpg><h2 data-gid=eWoCcso-RC dir=ltr>Amazon's trending bodysuit vs SKIMS Fits Everybody High Neck Bodysuit</h2><p id=e4yoLMKS5V data-wc=27>But how do the two bodysuits compare? Well, here's a list of Reoria bodysuit pros and cons that I put together from experience to help guide you.</p><p id=e5xlWbSuJOnD data-wc=1><strong>Pros:</strong>&nbsp;</p><p id=e8pFGM4EKeXD data-wc=38>If you are looking for a SKIMS lookalike, this one is so similar. I compared it to the description of the SKIMS Fits Everybody High Neck Bodysuit ($60) and found it literally shares many of the same details...</p><ul><li dir=ltr>High neck (front and back), YES</li><li dir=ltr>Fabric double layered, YES</li><li dir=ltr>Sporty neckline, YES</li><li dir=ltr>High cut leg opening, YES</li><li dir=ltr>Thong back remains invisible under clothing YES&nbsp;</li><li dir=ltr>Snap closure YES (The Reoria bodysuit has three silver metal snaps)</li><li dir=ltr>It feels like a light compression garment, giving a shapewear effect</li><li dir=ltr>Can be worn without a bra - as well as a strapless bra, racerback bra, boob tape or covers.</li><li dir=ltr>I also wondered if the Amazon bodysuit would hold up wash after wash (both the Reoria and SKIMS bodysuits are Hand Wash Only) but after a few months of washing, it still looks great, and has kept its shape.</li></ul><p id=eLsemW86p3nv data-wc=1><strong>Cons:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>The Reoria bodysuit does go up to XXL, but isn't as size inclusive as SKIMS, which runs up to a size 4X.</li><li dir=ltr>Unlike the SKIMS bodysuit,&nbsp;the Amazon bodysuit doesn’t feature a cotton gusset.</li><li dir=ltr>The Reoria bodysuit has a bothersome tag, which I ended up cutting out. &nbsp;</li><li dir=ltr>SKIMS’ Fits Everybody High Neck Bodysuit is 76% polyamide / 24% elastane; the Reoria bodysuit is 84% polyester / 16% spandex, which means it’s soft, but not quite as soft as a SKIMS look.</li><li dir=ltr>It’s long in the crotch area, as Amazon reviewers had pointed out. I’m on the taller side (nearly 5`9”) so it actually worked out for me but could see that it might be more of an issue for someone who is petite.</li></ul><h2 dir=ltr>Overall: Was the SKIMS bodysuit lookalike worth the money?&nbsp;</h2><p id=e4j0NTD4riE_ data-wc=45>Short answer: Yes, it was. I bought it in black but am seriously considering buying more colours. The cut of the top is so flattering, and the fabric having a bit less stretch means it is very form fitting, holding you in almost like shapewear.</p><p id=e8G55dcYtvWO data-wc=36>Will it stop me from buying SKIMS? Absolutely not! My <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopener nofollow">SKIMS loungewear dress (£78 / $78)</a></span> is hands down the most comfortable piece of clothing I own. So I’m making room in my closet for both.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="SKIMS' secret sale: 10 editor-approved looks that are up to 58% off" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/8b7dc4a12bb4-skims-secret-sale-2024-february.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="SKIMS' secret sale: 10 editor-approved looks that are up to 58% off" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>SKIMS' secret sale: 10 editor-approved looks that are up to 58% off</a></h5></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Lana Del Rey looks sensational in revealing lingerie for Kim Kardashian's SKIMS" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/af60a5c1f820-lana-del-rey-smiling-2.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Lana Del Rey looks sensational in revealing lingerie for Kim Kardashian's SKIMS" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Lana Del Rey looks sensational in revealing lingerie for Kim Kardashian's SKIMS</a></h5></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Best shapewear: From M&S to Spanx, Skims, John Lewis & MORE" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/24d298bb9796-best-shapewear-for-women.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Best shapewear: From M&S to Spanx, Skims, John Lewis & MORE" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Best shapewear: From M&S to Spanx, Skims, John Lewis & MORE</a></h5></li></ul><h2 dir=ltr>What Amazon shoppers are saying</h2><p id=eZQNfLYNOxPu data-wc=64>I'm not the only one who noticed the quality of this affordable wardrobe staple. One verified reviewer who compared the look to SKIMS wrote: "Wow wow wow!!! BUY THIS NOW! Where do I even start... This is absolutely stunning. It's true to size. The material is buttery soft.. the color is beautiful. And my 38 DDD chest is surprisingly supported by the stretchy material."</p><p id=emChw3-_kDtV data-wc=59>They continued: "There is a panel underneath the chest area but it does not have any type of support so it's hard to explain how exactly it supports.. but.. it just does! It's beautiful and smoothing. The thong is perfectly comfortable.... straps with the buttons are well made. I am literally ordering all the colors! So so worth it!!!!!"</p><p id=eLLgqjHKU5ZL data-wc=46>Only about 18% of shoppers who rated the Amazon bodysuit gave it less than four stars. Those that didn't like it cited it being "too long" or too revealing from the side and a few reviewers complained that bodysuit's lining is only in the bust area.</p><p id=eAj64fRoH9vD data-wc=21>Meanwhile, fans who might not have the fashion budget for SKIMS are saying the Reoria bodysuit is the next best thing.</p><p id=esem1aJcTVcu data-wc=27>“Amazing,” said another. “Look, I want Skims but I can’t afford that just yet. &nbsp;This is PERFECTION! It fits like a glove and makes me feel amazing.”</p><p id=eSSYQPV4oWwP data-wc=48>“LOVEEEEEEEEE THIS BODYSUIT,” raved one shopper. “I love the way this body suit fits! It’s sooo flattering and the material is really nice spandex feeling. It’s buttons on the bottom of the suit thankfully. I want to buy every color now! The look of Skims but way cheaper.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfqLWwvM%2BipaBnZWZ%2Fc4KUaK2iqpGherS3yKaqZpqfmca0wcitZJ2toJp6tb7InptmmZ6ZerWx0q2cnWc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./style-edit-richard-milles-72-01-lifestyle-house-chronograph-everyday-watch-nevertheless-another.html><span>←</span><span>Style Edit: Richard Milles 72-01 Lifestyle In-House Chronograph is an everyday watch that is neve</span></a>
