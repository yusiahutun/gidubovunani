While fans of the novel are afraid as always that the film won’t be able to capture the meditative, magnificent, mysterious story that they’ve read, hopes are high that the powerfully written characters, and the actors who portray them, will bring this story to life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>More than a murder mystery, and more than a coming of age story, the tale of Kya, the Marsh Girl, is one of solitude, melancholy, strength, love, and hope. With such a large audience already loving the story that author <strong>Delia Owens</strong> has written, the actors filling the shoes of the characters in this emotional tale surely feel the weight that the roles carry. All of them fans of the novel itself, the actors were reportedly excited to take on the roles every day that they were on set, giving the heartfelt, heavy story their all. Here’s a look at who will be portraying who in the dramatic, thrilling film.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/where-the-crawdads-sing-feature-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=# title="'Where the Crawdads Sing': Taylor Swift Releases &#34;Carolina&#34; Track and Lyric Video">'Where the Crawdads Sing': Taylor Swift Releases "Carolina" Track and Lyric Video</a></span></p><h2 id=daisy-edgar-jones-as-kya><a href=#>Daisy Edgar-Jones</a> as Kya</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screen-Shot-2022-03-22-at-113241-AM.png><p>Kya, abandoned in the marsh at the age of seven, leaves school after only one day of incessant teasing from her peers. Labeled the marsh girl by the townspeople of Barkley Cove, Kya hides out in her grandfather's fishing shack, making friends with the creatures and plants of the marsh, and living off of foraged mussels and ten-cent grits that she buys from her only human friend, Jumpin. Ruddy and brawny, yet slim and strikingly beautiful, Kya is a mysterious, celestial wonder to those who dare go near, yet those who do not understand her call her filthy marsh trash, and shame her for the way that she lives, not knowing that the child lives alone. After years of very little human interaction, Kya learns to keep herself safe from strangers by following what she has learned from the native wildlife, such as the deer who taught her to hide in the palmettos from predators, and the Cooper's Hawk who taught her that some people will come back. More than a murder suspect, Kya’s journey is painfully beautiful as she becomes a woman, learns to read and write, finds her first love, and toys with the idea of trusting humans. At the age of 22, she becomes a published author of marshland biology, an expert on the land that raised her, and builds herself a beautiful, yet lonely life. When a young local man is found dead in the marshes, however, her life of solitude beyond the oak trees turns to one behind bars, and Kya must learn to lean on those around her to fight for her freedom. Believing that her solitude is her strength, she must learn that her desire for love and kinship is what makes her weak. And it's okay to be weak.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Daisy Edgar-Jones</strong> will be taking on the role of the unkept and socially-feral naturalist Kya. You may recognize Edgar-Jones from her role as Marianne in the television series <a href=#><strong>Normal People</strong></a>. The London-born actress has recently appeared in many works as a breakout star, appearing in three films and five television series in the last three years alone. Most recently Edgar-Jones appeared in the comedy-thriller <a href=#><strong>Fresh</strong></a>, in which she portrays the lead character Noa, a woman who fights to survive the world of modern dating.</p><p>The role of the barefoot abandoned Little Kya will be taken on by young actress <strong>Jojo Regina</strong>. This will be Regina’s feature film debut, having previously acted in commercials.</p><h2 id=harris-dickinson-as-chase-andrews><a href=#>Harris Dickinson</a> as Chase Andrews</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/where-the-crawdads-sing-harris-dickinson.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The star football player, pride of his parents and the small town they reside in, Chase Andrews had it all; the fanciest bike, the most popular friends, the prettiest dates to the Elk’s lodge dances. But, there was something that he secretly wanted more than anything. One sunny afternoon, while throwing a football around on the beach, Chase happens to spot a wild-haired, muddied, stunning beauty hiding from him behind the ferns. Her deep, dark eyes staring back at him with a fear of holding another person's gaze. He wanted her but said that the strange Marsh Girl couldn’t be part of his regular, popular, man-of-the-town life. Years later, Chase is found dead at the base of the lonely fire tower outside of town. An apparent accident, but the local sheriff isn’t so sure.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Harris Dickinson</strong>, an actor, director, and writer, takes on the role of the good ol’ boy town hero, Chase Andrews. Dickinson is known for his starring roles in the <strong>Kingsman </strong>prequel movie, <a href=#><strong>The King's Man</strong></a>, and as Frankie in the dark and dreamy drama, <strong>Beach Rats</strong>, where he portrays a troubled young man experimenting with drugs and his sexuality. Dickinson’s performance in the haunting story was powerful as his character wrestled with heavy emotions. Fans of the novel hope to see Dickinson bring the same emotional intensity to his character in Where the Crawdads Sing. Apart from his role as the chauvinistic murder victim in the novel-based crime-thriller, Dickinson has four other projects in the works for this year, including two more murder mysteries: the comedy film <a href=#><strong>See How They Run</strong></a>, and a television miniseries titled <strong>Retreat</strong>.</p><h2 id=taylor-john-smith-as-tate-walker>Taylor John Smith as Tate Walker</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/where-the-crawdads-sing-taylor-john-smith.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fishing by himself in the twisting marshland, his unruly blonde curls stuffed under a baseball cap, Tate Walker is approached by a seven-year-old girl, alone and lost in her father's dingy old boat. The boy helps the lost Marsh Girl find her way home, and as the years draw on he becomes somewhat close to her, or rather as close as she will allow him. Eventually teaching her to read and write, she lets him, and only him, into her home and her world. By the age of fifteen, she explores the marshland with him, sharing a love of the plants, creatures, pebbles, and shells, though something more blossoms between them just before Tate must leave for school in another city. When he returns four years later he tries to patch things up with the young woman he left behind, but Kya is wary of trusting him ever again.</p><p><strong>Taylor John Smith</strong>, who is known for his role as Bash Casey in the 2016 film <a href=#><strong>Cruel Intentions</strong></a>, takes on the role of the kind and understanding biology scholar Tate Walker. Smith is no stranger to working in the genre of thrillers, having previously taken on the character of John Keene in the mini-series <strong>Sharp Objects</strong>, a murder mystery set in the south, which is based on the synonymously named novel by Gone Girl author <strong>Gillian Flynn</strong>. Smith is known for his smoldering gaze and light-hearted, calm demeanor, which made him a perfect fit for the role of the heart-on-his-sleeve scientist.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=garret-dillahunt-as-pa><a href=#>Garret Dillahunt</a> as Pa</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/fear-the-walking-dead-garret-dillahunt.jpg><p>One of the most pivotal and hard-hitting characters of the story is Pa. An abusive drunk, Pa is known for existing only in two states: silence and shouting, which made hiding from him in the lush forest a normal occurrence for his wife and children. His belligerence is the reason that Kya’s Ma and four siblings left. Awaking from a drunken stupor, it took Pa some time to realize that his four eldest children followed in the footsteps of his estranged wife, taking leave of the rickety shack with him left to care for his seven-year-old daughter. Unable to care for himself even, Pa put Kya in charge of the cleaning, cooking, and grocery shopping until one day when he didn’t return from a night of gambling and drinking, leaving Kya to fend for herself in the swampy wilderness. Pa hadn’t always been poor, but after his parents lost their plantation, the young man pawned the last of their treasures and used the money to woo an unsuspecting young woman, who soon came to be his wife. After taking shrapnel to his leg in the war, and not being given the promotions he wanted from his father-in-law, Pa gave up, moving his family from their large home in New Orleans to the shack in North Carolina, drinking his days away until his family couldn’t take it anymore. Pa is an important character in Kya’s development, having his relationship with Ma be the only example of love and romance that she knew growing up, leaving her guarded yet curious as she becomes a woman.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Garret Dillahunt</strong> will take on the role of belligerent, never-sober Pa.

He has also recently appeared in the long-running series <strong>Fear the Walking Dead</strong>, in which he portrays John Dorie, a bearded, depressed character whose dearest love left him, much like the character he takes on in Where the Crawdads Sing.</p><h2 id=ahna-o-rsquo-reilly-as-ma>Ahna O’Reilly as Ma</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/totem-ahna-oreilly.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ma had no idea what she was getting into when she married Pa. A young woman from a well-off family, she was tricked by the man who used pawn shop money to take her on fancy dinner dates. Her father gave her new husband a job at his shoe factory, but when Pa returned from the war and moved her and her children to the shack, her grand life of frilly dresses and sunny afternoons on wrap-around porches was turned upside down. Ma took the brunt of the abuse from her husband, until one day she suffered from a mental breakdown, packed her things, and left, walking down the sandy road in her fake alligator skin pumps, suitcase in hand. It takes Kya years to understand why Ma left her and her four siblings there with Pa, but as she comes into adulthood Kya learns the truth, and decides she doesn’t want to live the way Ma did, hiding in fear.</p><p>The unstable yet loving Ma will be portrayed by <strong>Ahna O’Reilly</strong>.

Unable to look Jodie in the eyes as he explained why he had to go, Kya could hear in the way that he spoke that Pa had beaten him to a pulp, and the young man told his sister that he couldn't stay there any longer.
