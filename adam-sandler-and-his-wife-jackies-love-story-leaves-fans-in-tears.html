They met four years earlier in 1999 while on the set of the <a href=#>movie</a> Big Daddy, where she scored a small role as a waitress while he played the lead, Sonny Koufax. They became engaged in 2002 and married the next year. Ever since, Adam has paid the sweetest of tributes to Jackie in speeches, interviews, and <a href=#>Instagram</a> posts. Here are some of his most recent public declarations of love for her.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-adam-sandler-calls-wife-jackie-his-forever-girl>Adam Sandler calls wife Jackie his ‘forever girl’</h2><p>At the <a href=#>People’s Choice Awards</a> this year, Adam Sandler gave the cutest shout-out to his wife Jackie when he won the People’s Choice Icon Award.</p><p>“My darling wife Jackie,” he said at the <a href=#>award show</a>, “you are my partner for life. I love every car ride and every kiss we’ve ever had, forever and ever my girl.”</p><p>In his Mark Twain Prize <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">speech</a>, after he won the award last year, he paid tribute to his loved ones, including Jackie. He did so after talking about how he deals with his films getting bad reviews.</p><p>The <a href=#>celebrity</a> said: “People always would ask me, ‘Those bad reviews you get, how does that make you feel? Make you feel like f****** s***?’ And I’d say, no, it really doesn’t. I think the reason I get to say that didn’t hurt me is ’cause so many of you guys in this room made me feel great about what we’ve done together.</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>Benny Blanco throws it back to 2007 in adorable Valentine’s tribute to Selena Gomez</a></p><p>“And all my fellow comedians, actors, writers, collaborators, crew members, people on the streets, my family, my kids, my forever girl Jackie, all make me feel like the critics didn’t know what the hell they were talking about. So thank you for all that. Thank you. Thank you for creating a delusional, psychotic man.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-his-daughters-wrote-the-actor-s-speech-and-dedicated-it-to-their-mom>His daughters wrote the actor’s speech and dedicated it to their mom</h2><p>In another, it was his children who recognized how great their mom was. They hilariously wrote his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">speech</a> when he picked up the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Gotham Awards. At the time, his daughters Sadie and Sunny were 16 and 14 respectively.</p><p>“Thank you, Mommy, for putting up with Daddy and his crazy f****** mood swings all these years. Now that truly is a feat deserving of a lifetime award.”</p><p>During an interview with Entertainment Tonight, the 57-year-old <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a> of his 20-year marriage: “Well, we’ve been together for 25 [years],&nbsp;so we always act like that’s our anniversary, the night we met.”</p><p>“But 20 is good. Yeah, 20 years of marriage, that’s nice,” he added.</p><p>He also complimented Jackie and seemingly revealed his favorite physical feature of hers. He said: “She’s got good legs, yeah. She’s got better legs than me, I’ll give her that!”</p><p>Taking to his <a href=#>Instagram</a> in June last year, he commemorated their 20th wedding anniversary.</p><p>Sharing a picture of them both on their wedding day, Adam Sandler wrote to his wife: “Happy 20th my sweet Jackie! Your “I do” was the best gift of my life. My heart has been yours since the first second I saw you, and I love and appreciate your devoted soul more and more each day.&nbsp;Us. The kids.</p><p>“Let’s keep going and going, babe. Lots of love to give you. Always.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-people-can-t-cope-with-how-cute-the-couple-are>People can’t cope with how cute the couple are</h2><p>In the comments under Adam Sandler’s post about his wife Jackie, people gushed about how adorable the pair were.</p><p>One wrote: “Happy Anniversary! Your love and compassion permeate the screen for your friends and family. You’re a good man Mr. Sandler and it’s evident you picked an equally kind Mrs. Sandler.”</p><p>Another said: “That’s so cute. I am melted.”</p><p>A third penned: “We all should have husbands like Adam Sandler. Guys, be like Adam Sandler.”</p><p>Others on X (formerly <a href=#>Twitter</a>) are equally enamored with Adam and Jackie after the awards show last night.</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck share steamy ‘Valentine’s Kiss’ at singer’s movie premiere</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2aGcK3DmqRmq5Gjsa2x0WaYp5xdnba0edainZ5lmpawrLXErGSlp6aaerTAzquwZqSVlsOmv4yfmKerXZ67bsDEmqmsZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./7-cristiano-ronaldos-most-expensive-watches-his-bugatti-inspired-jacob-co-timepiece-and-diamond.html><span>←</span><span>7 of Cristiano Ronaldos most expensive watches: from his Bugatti-inspired Jacob &amp;amp; Co. timepiece a</span></a>
