(TND) — </span>A GOP councilman in Indiana has announced that he now identifies as a woman of color and a lesbian, but critics say they believe he is just being insincere and mocking marginalized people by doing so.</p><p>Delaware County Councilman Ryan Webb announced <a href=# title=https://www.facebook.com/ryan.webb.944/posts/pfbid02G6tgbWFCCPxpqV6Y2QE34RPxVUTe7wjYdfaEpPAqjq4yCPJBkFRZxdX3DmHPqZhal class=themeColorForLinks>on Facebook</a> that he had "decided to come out and finally feel comfortable announcing my true authentic self."<br></p>It is with great relief that I announce to everyone that I identify as a woman and not just any woman but as a woman of color as well. I guess this would make me gay/lesbian as well, since I am attracted to women.," Webb said.Whew, that felt good to finally get that out there and start living life as my true self. I’m excited to bring some diversity to the county council," Webb added, "Until today we didn’t have any females of color or LGBTQIAPC+++ on the council. I’m glad that now we do!"<p>Webb also included a "winky face" emoji in his Facebook announcement. Many of the replies to his post call Webb "pathetic" and "embarrassing" for his perceived mockery of transgender, nonbinary and other LGBT groups.</p><p>Delaware County's government website says Webb is a father of five and married to his wife Brandy. In his coming out announcement, Webb clarifies that everyone can continue calling him "Ryan" or "Councilman Webb" and that he will retain his preferred pronouns of "He/Him."<br></p>However, this will in no way diminish my true identity as a woman of color," Webb claims in the post.<p>In a later edit of the same post, Webb adds that it had come to his attention that his new identity "more than likely" makes him "the very first lesbian woman of color in the history of Delaware County to ever serve on the Delaware county council."</p><p>Webb added that he was "honored" to be the person to "shatter that glass ceiling." Webb also added the hashtag "#GirlPower" in his edit. Webb also edited his announcement from originally claiming his new identity aligned with that of a Black woman to the current reading, where he maintains calling himself a woman of color.</p><p>When local news station <a href=# title=https://www.wishtv.com/news/i-team-8/indiana-county-councilman-comes-out-as-woman-of-color/ class=themeColorForLinks>WISH-TV</a> reached out to Webb asking if he would like to do an interview on his new identity, Webb reportedly declined an on-camera interview, but still provided a statement.</p><p>The councilman told the news station that his family had been "receiving violent threats throughout the day from intolerant liberals who refuse to accept my decision to live my life however I choose," and that he didn't "really see how an interview will improve the situation."</p>It is unfortunate, but a group called Indiana Progressives has decided to organize a hate and harassment campaign against me and my family by publishing my address and encouraging people to unlawfully congregate at my home," Webb told WISH-TV. "I have to look out for the safety of my family, including our 6 children. There are people with serious mental health issues encouraging people who are unwelcome to come to my home, so I think it’s best to politely decline your on-camera interview."<p>Webb reportedly added that he found it "unfortunate" he could not "simply be given the same space and respect to explore my identity that so many of those targeting me demand for themselves." Webb also told WISH-TV that while his "American Indian heritage is not up for debate," it remains "possible I may change my mind down the road."</p>I hope that in the future those asking for tolerance and understanding are willing to give it in return and not just to those who they feel is worthy of it," Webb added. "Nobody has the authority to validate or invalidate any individual who chooses to identify a certain way."<p>Again, Webb's critics simply don't believe he is adopting a new identity, and is instead mocking transgender, nonbinary and other marginalized people with his public social media post.</p><p>The National Desk reached out to Webb for comment and clarification on his announcement. Webb said the following:</p>Thanks for reaching out. I don’t believe I am compelled to offer anyone and proof of my sincerity or pass any perceived litmus test of questions in order to live my life however I choose. If they don’t want to accept my position of identifying however I choose then that is their issue, not mine. As of today I have yet to hear of any other individual who was pressured to “prove” their gender identity. How I identify is how I identify, it’s as simple as that and isn’t up for debate. I’m focused on my private life as well as my duties serving the people of Delaware County.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivmpawtcKNnKamZ56axLR7zZqroqeeYsSwvsudZqudoKqvrbXCmqVmm5%2Bqu7XFjJymrqaTnrmurc1mmKemn6q7pLHSZp%2BeZZ6kxG61w56lraGWnrK0ecCsZJplnJrAo7XAp2Sonl2YvK270WasqauVqcBuuMabq2aZlKu8pK3TnqpmoZ6ZtqK6wGabnqSnlr%2BmecKorKesqWK%2Fuq3NZq6empJixLC5wKc%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2frepublican-county-councilman-announces-he-now-identifies-as-a-lesbian-of-color-upsets-lgbt-advocates-indiana-delware-county-ryan-webb-woman.html&text=GOP%20councilman%20announces%20he%20identifies%20as%20lesbian%20%27woman%20of%20color%2c%27%20angering%20LGBT%20activists&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frepublican-county-councilman-announces-he-now-identifies-as-a-lesbian-of-color-upsets-lgbt-advocates-indiana-delware-county-ryan-webb-woman.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2frepublican-county-councilman-announces-he-now-identifies-as-a-lesbian-of-color-upsets-lgbt-advocates-indiana-delware-county-ryan-webb-woman.html&title=GOP%20councilman%20announces%20he%20identifies%20as%20lesbian%20%27woman%20of%20color%2c%27%20angering%20LGBT%20activists" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2frepublican-county-councilman-announces-he-now-identifies-as-a-lesbian-of-color-upsets-lgbt-advocates-indiana-delware-county-ryan-webb-woman.html&title=GOP%20councilman%20announces%20he%20identifies%20as%20lesbian%20%27woman%20of%20color%2c%27%20angering%20LGBT%20activists" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2frepublican-county-councilman-announces-he-now-identifies-as-a-lesbian-of-color-upsets-lgbt-advocates-indiana-delware-county-ryan-webb-woman.html&title=GOP%20councilman%20announces%20he%20identifies%20as%20lesbian%20%27woman%20of%20color%2c%27%20angering%20LGBT%20activists" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frepublican-county-councilman-announces-he-now-identifies-as-a-lesbian-of-color-upsets-lgbt-advocates-indiana-delware-county-ryan-webb-woman.html&description=GOP%20councilman%20announces%20he%20identifies%20as%20lesbian%20%27woman%20of%20color%2c%27%20angering%20LGBT%20activists" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./predatory-pastor-abused-power-to-sexually-abuse-girl-on-church-floor-in-takoma-park-prosecutor.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Predatory Pastor Abused Power To Sexually Abuse Girl On Church Floor In Takoma Park: Prosecutor">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./glowy-zoey-costume-halloweeen.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Glowy Zoey Halloween Costumes Turn Your Kid Into Stick Figures">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
