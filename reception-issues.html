All of the Quad Cities area commercial television stations are broadcasting full-power, high-definition television signals but if you are relying on an antenna to receive the over-the-air signals, there are some important things you need to know, some of which may be causing you to get some of the stations and not others.

When a VHF signal hits the walls of a house, it tends to ricochet and refract and weaken significantly. &nbsp;As a result, the further you live from the signal origination source, the less likely it is that an indoor antenna will be sufficient to reliably receive a low-band VHF signal. &nbsp;<strong>An outdoor antenna is strongly recommended for the reception of a VHF signal</strong>(WHBF). &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Antennas</strong>&nbsp;– If you are utilizing an indoor antenna, the type of antenna in use can be important too.&nbsp; We have found that the flat, rectangular antennas are not very effective, while what we call&nbsp; “hoop-and-rabbit-ears” tend to work the best. &nbsp;Also, with digital signals, electronic signal boosters are ineffective at best and may actually inhibit your ability to receive area signals.&nbsp;<strong>In most cases outside the immediate metro, your best bet is to utilize an outdoor antenna.</strong></p><p><strong>Signal Origination&nbsp;</strong>– KGCW, KLJB and WQAD are each broadcasting from locations in Orion, IL. KWQC is broadcasting from Bettendorf, Iowa as is WHBF-TV. &nbsp; If you are using an outdoor antenna, depending on your location, antenna orientation may be a factor. &nbsp;The UHF element of the antenna should be pointed toward Orion and the VHF portion toward Bettendorf.</p><p><strong>Signal Quality</strong>&nbsp;– Unlike the analog signals that preceded them, digital signals are generally an “all or nothing proposition”; Either you get a clear signal or you get no reception at all. &nbsp; So even though you are seeing nothing, you may be very close.&nbsp; The switch to an outdoor antenna would be the easiest and most effective solution.&nbsp;&nbsp; Short of that, a different antenna, or adjustments to the current antenna could make the small difference necessary.</p><p><strong>Channel Scans</strong>&nbsp;–&nbsp;It is also important to note that digital tuners of all kinds do have a tendency to “drop” channels from time to time. For that reason,&nbsp;<strong>regular channel scans</strong>&nbsp;are always a good idea.&nbsp; Something else you might try is what we call a&nbsp;<strong>system re-boot</strong>&nbsp;in which you a) disconnect your antenna cable from your television/converter box; b) Scan for channels with no antenna attached (this should effectively re-set your TV/converter box to ‘factory settings’; &nbsp;c) Unplug the television/converter box from the power source for five minutes (this will re-boot its systems); d) Plug the device back in, reconnect the antenna and re-scan for channels.&nbsp;</p><p>For sound advice on your antenna needs, we have been recommending a call to&nbsp;Kevin at Warren Electronics in Moline at 309-743-0383.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfp7Kksc%2BtoKimXZ7AtMHErGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kevin-bacon-death-co-star-cancer-heartbreaking-month.html><span>←</span><span>Kevin Bacon faces heartache as co-star passes away from cancer</span></a>
