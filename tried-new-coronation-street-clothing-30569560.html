And where better than the seaside town of Whitby – home to Goths, Dracula and… apparently quite a few Corrie fans.</p><p>Honestly, when heading out, I didn’t expect anyone to recognise what I was wearing, especially as the dress’s print is so subtle! As opposed to Primark’s Greggs merch, it doesn’t have the words Coronation Street pasted over the front.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article30567284.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/0_EHP_CHP_270723Saw_X_83718JPG.jpg><p>Which made it even more special when I connected with other soap fans. While browsing a bookshop, one staff member shyly approached me to ask: “Is that Coronation Street on your dress?”</p><p>I was gobsmacked.</p><p>It was such a sweet moment – and made all the more perfect knowing that I wasn’t cringing in a set of merch that brazenly advertised whatever fandom I’m currently repping.</p><p>Another thing about this collection is the quality. The sizing is perfect, the buttons on the dress don’t gape, and all the material is so, so creamy.</p><p>Also, the dress has pockets. Pockets!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><p>The redbrick cardigan is another of my favourites, with buttons down the front and a really cosy feel to it – perfect for an autumn evening before you huddle down to watch the soaps on TV.</p><p>And the attention to detail is really something else. Joanie Brand Director Lucy explained that she worked with ITV producers to “ensure the devil was in the detail”.</p><p>That included “making sure the window lintels to the famous terrace were perfectly accurate, matching the window graphics in Dev’s corner shop to ensure continuity [and] making sure Norris’ paperboy was standing outside the Kabin”.</p><p>All of the six pieces in the collection are made with responsible fabrics, and honestly, you can tell.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article30569584.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_IMG_8854.jpg><p><b>For more of the latest showbiz news from Daily Star, make sure you sign up to one of our newsletters </b><a data-content-type=section data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#><b>here.</b></a></p><p>Finally, a long day of shopping done, it was time to settle down, and I couldn’t think of a better way to finish my Corrie-themed day than sipping on a gin cocktail using the official Coronation Street gin, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Wonky Duck.</a></p><p>The No.186 gin was crafted in tribute to the legend that is Hilda Ogden, with Corrie partnering with the Manchester distillery to craft the liquor.</p><p>Hilda’s wonky duck mural is considered a staple of the show, so it made perfect sense to name the gin after it. It’s even Eccles Cake flavoured.</p><p>My advice? Mix the gin with diet lemonade. It really brings out the fruity flavours without being overpowered by the fizz. Wonky Duck made the perfect summer drink to end the day on.</p><p>Am I living in Weatherfield right now?</p><p><b>Follow Daily Star on Threads </b><a href=# rel=nofollow><b>here.</b></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKymZMGztcSdZKedp2KwsL7Op5itoZ%2BjerTA0Z6crWWToby1tMinnmZrYGqDeoGVaQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./660ed7d3e2704eccb88b4587-html.html><span>←</span><span>Granada - Valencia | LaLiga EA Sports: Almeida aferra al Valencia a Europa</span></a>
