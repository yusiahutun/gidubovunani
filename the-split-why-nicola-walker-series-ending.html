She explained: "I always intended it to be this three-arc structure, that was about the legacy of a marital split that permeates Hannah's life, and then that triggers her own split within her own relationship, and then subsequent split in her marriage."</p><p id=eeijAd1zfvr- data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>The Split third and final series: everything we know so far</a></strong></p><p id=e43gVcMV6Meg data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Everything you need to know about The Split star Nicola Walker</a></strong></p><p id=eR2YeCy70gJO data-wc=45>As for how she feels now that the end has finally come and will soon be airing, she added: "I <strong>think it's like the end of any good relationship, it's conflicted! </strong>I feel really happy and proud and excited to be showing this final series."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e2fd33b853a0-split-nicola-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e_jPTVkZH1i9 data-wc=9><strong>Nicola Walker&nbsp;leads the cast of&nbsp;the BBC series</strong></p><p id=ebwahktPQKXY data-wc=34>Meanwhile, <strong>Nicola herself also opened up about how "difficult" it was saying goodbye</strong> to both her character and her on-screen family.
