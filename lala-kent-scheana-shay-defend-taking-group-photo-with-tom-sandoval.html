It, like, still blows my mind that people don't realize we're still filming a show," she said, adding, "And it was that girl's birthday! What are we gonna be like, 'No. Absolutely not.' Like, no, 'Happy birthday, let's take a f---ing picture.' It's called adulting."</p><p>Scheana added that she just coincidentally was standing next to Sandoval in the photo.</p><p>"We're in a group. We're all here. We hopped in a photo," she explained. "You know what? I happened to be standing where I was standing."</p><p>"I take photos with strangers every f---ing day. That's how you take a photo," she said. "I stand like that. I smile. I tilt my head to my good side."</p><p>In the shot, below, Scheana and Lala -- along with Sandoval, Tom Schwartz, James Kennedy, Ally Weber and Brock Davies -- posed for a picture with a fan.</p><p>The Bravo stars were filming together in Lake Tahoe to support <a href=#><strong>Lisa Vanderpump's</strong></a> upcoming restaurant, Wolf.</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>In addition to her Instagram Story post, Scheana addressed the apparent backlash over the group photo on Twitter, clapped back at social media users who claimed she had "forgiven" Sandoval after he cheated on his girlfriend of nearly 10 years, Ariana Madix, and had a secret affair with their co-star, Raquel Leviss.</p><p>Scheana replied to a Bravo fan account that shared a video of the cast -- including Sandoval -- walking together in Lake Tahoe.</p><p>"Is that Sandoval's voice? All is forgiven, I guess," the tweet read, to which Scheana replied, "Who said all is forgiven?? We are all here for Lisa."</p><p>When a fan came to Scheana's defense, noting that she always poses for photos, Scheana quoted the tweet, and wrote, "Literally! I’m posing in a photo for a fan. I take photos w strangers on the daily and have my arm bent up behind ppl. End of story. Should I look miserable in a group fan photo I got thrown in walking to our car?"</p><p>She also clapped back at a user who claimed "all is forgiven or else you wouldn't be there," saying that Scheana was using Lisa as an "excuse." Scheana replied, "Soooo I shouldn’t be here doing my job!?"</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Who said all is forgiven??
