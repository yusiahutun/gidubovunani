Prince the polymath in full and frightening effect, across funk, rock and genres yet to be given names. A double album with scarcely a sub-phenomenal moment.

Cohesive and ice cream-cool, nobody would guess it was a soundtrack for a (sub-par) film. And it has “Kiss” on it.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>3 Purple Rain </strong>1984 <strong>★★★★★</strong><br></p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Too obvious? Like naming Ziggy Stardust as your favourite Bowie album? Who cares. A concise showcase for Prince’s wares, from instant to experimental to epic. Uber-pop perfection.</p><figure id=7553fa2c-f490-45ad-a133-40b4b7845b71 data-spacefinder-role=supporting data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-a2pvoh><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>Dirty Mind 1980</span></figure><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>4</strong> <strong>Dirty Mind </strong>1980 <strong>★★★★★</strong><br></p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Incorporating the sharp minimalist sensibility of the New Wave into his own sex-funk agenda, the album with which Prince really found his direction.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>5 1999 </strong>1982<strong> ★★★★★</strong><br></p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Bold double album on which Prince and his Revolution fully embrace synthesizers, while making a blatant grab for pop glory with that “1999”/ “Little Red Corvette” one-two.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>6 Around The World In A Day </strong>1985 <strong>★★★★★</strong></p><p class=dcr-epamsi>The album that threw the Purple Rain kids off-balance, with its opulent psych-pop textures, but which always sounds better than you think it will, when you revisit.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>7 Lovesexy </strong>1988 <strong>★★★★★</strong><br></p><p class=dcr-epamsi>The last Prince album, chronologically speaking, from his intimidatingly Midas-fingered infallible years. Sequenced as one long track on CD, annoyingly.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>8 Diamonds And Pearls </strong>1991 <strong>★★★★</strong><br></p><p class=dcr-epamsi>The first of many “stunning returns to form”, but worthy of the cliché. Highlights: the thoughtfully mature “Money Don’t Matter 2 Nite” and the hilariously immature “Gett Off”.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>9 Prince </strong>1979 <strong>★★★★</strong><br></p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Still incredibly young, Prince shows he has already mastered disco and soul, and on tracks like the hard rock “Bambi”, that he’s itching to stray into other territories.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>10 Controversy </strong>1981<strong> ★★★★</strong><br></p><p class=dcr-epamsi>A stopgap delivering little that Dirty Mind hasn’t already given us, but with “Jack U Off”, the iconic title track and the sublime “Do Me Baby” on board, there is joy in repetition.</p><figure id=8e30401b-a0a1-4a0f-8342-6fc248d531b1 data-spacefinder-role=supporting data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-a2pvoh><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>Lovesexy 1988</span></figure><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>11 The Black Album </strong>1987/1994 <strong>★★★★</strong><br></p><p class=dcr-epamsi>A hard, heavy funk disc whose mystique (due to being withdrawn at the last minute and bootlegged by the million) perhaps outstrips its quality, but when it fires, it really fires.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>12 The Gold Experience </strong>1995 <strong>★★★★</strong></p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Containing his only UK No1, “The Most Beautiful Girl In The World”, and the astonishing courtroom-based “Eye Hate U”, this lavish record deserves more love.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>13 Love Symbol </strong>1992<strong> ★★★★</strong></p><p class=dcr-epamsi>His name is Prince. And he is funky. So he tells us on the album whose official title is the unpronounceable symbol he will later adopt instead of Prince. Confused?</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>14 For You </strong>1978 <strong>★★★★</strong><br></p><p class=dcr-epamsi>An accomplished funk and soul debut from a precocious 19-year-old, but no hint whatsoever of the outrageously gifted talent that was soon to emerge.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>15 Hitnrun Phase Two </strong>2015<strong> ★★★★</strong><br></p><p class=dcr-epamsi>What turned out to be Prince’s farewell was arguably his most consistently satisfying work since Lovesexy, from the breezy “Baltimore” to the dark and cryptic “Revelation”.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>16 Graffiti Bridge </strong>1990<strong> ★★★</strong><br></p><p class=dcr-epamsi>OK, so the film (a sort-of sequel to Purple Rain) sucked like a Dyson, but with “Thieves In The Temple” and “Question Of U” on the soundtrack, that could be forgiven.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>17 Crystal Ball / The Truth</strong> 1998<strong> ★★★</strong><br></p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Sprawling, revamped box-set version of abandoned mid-80s project, initiated post-Parade, including acoustic and instrumental sides. Vital for the original “P(ussy) Control”.</p><figure id=142545fa-abc1-4552-a2de-1644482dddaf data-spacefinder-role=supporting data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-a2pvoh><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>3121 2006</span></figure><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>18 3121 </strong>2006<strong> ★★★</strong><br></p><p class=dcr-epamsi>The thwacking single “Black Sweat” was a banger unlike anything he’d released in 20 years, and did a lot to carry this playful, likeable pop-funk set.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>19 Come </strong>1994<strong> ★★★</strong><br></p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Rolled out with little fanfare, its artwork effectively proclaiming Prince dead (with the dates 1958-1993) Come is a superior class of contract-fulfiller.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>20 The Vault: Old Friends 4 Sale </strong>1999<strong> ★★★</strong><br></p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Controversial taster from Prince’s fabled Vault of thousands of unreleased songs. Fans would tell you the bootlegs are better. Fans would be correct.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>21 Plectrumelectrum </strong>2014<strong> ★★★</strong><br></p><p class=dcr-epamsi>The only album released with all-female rock trio 3rdEyeGirl, who toughened up his sound and made his 2014 Hit & Run gigs a wonder to behold.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>22 Art Official Age </strong>2014<strong> ★★★</strong><br></p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Released alongside 3rdEyeGirl’s Plectrumelectrum, this lush, creamy album showed that Prince still had too many ideas for one discography to contain.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>23 Hitnrun Phase One </strong>2015<strong> ★★★</strong><br></p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Far from universally adored by critics, this Tidal-premiered release nevertheless had its moments, such as the jubilant “Fallinlove2nite”.</p><figure id=fe5536c9-3219-4fd3-ad04-1a93dd6a759c data-spacefinder-role=supporting data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-a2pvoh><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>Emancipation 1996</span></figure><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>24 Emancipation </strong>1996<strong> ★★★</strong><br></p><p class=dcr-epamsi>When EMI signed Prince and he immediately dropped a triple-album, they must have thought he was trolling them. If you sift, you will find jewels.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>25 Batman</strong> 1989 <strong>★★★</strong><br></p><p class=dcr-epamsi>A rare case of Prince doing something for cash and profile. “Batdance” was fun, “Scandalous” a decent sex jam, but “Partyman” is a big hollow nothing.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>26 Musicology </strong>2004<strong> ★★★</strong><br></p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Prince comes in from the cold with his first major label (Columbia) release in years, and an impressive cast of collaborators (Sheila E, Maceo Parker, Candy Dulfer).</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>27 Planet Earth </strong>2007<strong> ★★★</strong><br></p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Though given away free to anyone who attended his 21 Nights In London residency, as well as Mail On Sunday readers, lead single “Guitar” would have been worth paying for.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>28 Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic </strong>1999 <strong>★★★</strong><br></p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Riddled with collaborations (Gwen Stefani, Eve, Sheryl Crow, Ani DiFranco, Chuck D), this one-off Arista release seemed calculated to aim for the charts. It didn’t quite work.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>29 Lotusflow3r/Mplsound </strong>2009<strong> ★★★</strong><br></p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Startlingly successful self-released double, or triple (it was packaged with the debut by Prince protege Bria Valente), featuring some of his heaviest riffing for some time.</p><figure id=b013999d-cd4d-45e8-a475-a29419531fc4 data-spacefinder-role=supporting data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-a2pvoh><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>One Nite Alone 2002</span></figure><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>30 One Nite Alone </strong>2002<strong> ★★★</strong><br></p><p class=dcr-epamsi>A little-heard piano-and-microphone release via NPG, which foreshadowed the format of Prince’s final tour, and featured beautiful Joni Mitchell cover “Case Of U”.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>31 Chaos And Disorder </strong>1996<strong> ★★★</strong><br></p><p class=dcr-epamsi>The final instalment of Prince’s SLAVE-cheeked, symbol-named strop with Warner Bros, but tracks like “Dinner With Delores” were far from phoned-in.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>32 Xpectation </strong>2003<strong> ★★★</strong><br></p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Nine mellow instrumental jazz cuts, all beginning with ‘X’, released as a download in one of Prince’s “actually, I like the internet” moods. Much cooler than it has any right to be.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>33 The Chocolate Invasion </strong>2004<strong> ★★★</strong><br></p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Unintentionally tittersome title aside, an inconsistent patchwork of tracks previously given away on his NPG Music Club website. Worth seeking out single “Supercute”.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>34 The Slaughterhouse </strong>2004<strong> ★★★</strong><br></p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Another instalment of previously downloadable tracks, and Prince’s last attempt for a while to make an album himself before getting back into bed with the industry.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>35 20Ten </strong>2010<strong> ★★</strong><br></p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Given away with the Daily Mirror, whose Tony Parsons declared it as good as Purple Rain, 1999 and Sign ‘O’ The Times.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>36 The Rainbow Children </strong>2001<strong> ★★</strong><br></p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Notable for Prince’s growing fondness for the two Js: jazz and the Jehovah’s Witness faith. Gigs around this time could be hard work.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>37 N.E.W.S. </strong>2003 <strong>★★</strong><br></p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Four very long (14-minute) instrumental jazz funk tracks, chiefly intended as a vehicle for saxophonist Eric Leeds. Prince’s lowest-selling album. Can’t imagine why.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoKyaqpSerq96wqikaKWlqLake5FpaG9nkaW%2FcH6RaKeroZ6Ysm6x1Z6psmWRoa%2B2uYyrmK2dlGKur7CMq5ino5WZ</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./newt-gingrichs-wife-mocked-poorly-edited-photo-html.html><span>←</span><span>Newt Gingrich's wife is mocked for poorly edited photo</span></a>
