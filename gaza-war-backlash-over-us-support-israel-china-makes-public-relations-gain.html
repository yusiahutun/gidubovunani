Observers say China appears to be gaining diplomatically from this stance.
Zhu Yongbiao, from the politics and international relations school at Lanzhou University, said the war has had an impact on US-China rivalry given Washington’s shift in focus from the Middle East to containing China."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
