Ultimately, Rucker never publicly threw his support behind the presidential candidate.</p><p>"That shocked me," he tells Taste of Country with a laugh about his name being mentioned in one of the Wikileaks emails. "I'm just not in politics. It wasn't that I'm not supporting this person or that person, it's just that I didn't want to get involved in politics, and here I am being brought in…It was weird."</p><p>Though he has no plans to enter the political realm anytime soon, Rucker does have a new album in the works. He released the first single, "<a href=#>If I Told You</a>," in June of 2016. "I love that song," he says. "That one I heard and I just instantly fell in love with it... I'm just proud to see it do well and I'm ready to put out that new record."</p><p>One song off this new record that&nbsp;he's most excited for fans to hear is "Something for the First Time," which he's planning on releasing as the next single. "It's just a great song," Rucker says. "I can't wait to get it out there."</p><p><strong>Who Are Country Stars Supporting in the 2016 Election?</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmnZminsK0edGumqSdomK1qrjLmqmyZZOhtq%2FAzqdknqWRnrm0ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./beyonc-strips-dazzling-nude-illusion-29954608.html><span>←</span><span>Beyonc strips to dazzling nude illusion bodysuit as she exposes endless legs on stage</span></a>
