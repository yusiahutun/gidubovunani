The costume department clearly pulled out all the stops – Selena, or rather Mabel Mora, we should say, looked utterly beautiful in a strapless fitted lace bodice which extended out into a wide floor-skimming skirt. The dress also featured a mesh overlay and white floral adornments which felt harmonious with short gloves and a scalloped-edge sheer veil.</p><p id=ei7V0hTtyzJo data-wc=56>Straying from bridal convention, her character swerved heels in favour of thick sole Dr. Martens which peeked out from under her gown.&nbsp;The look was in keeping with the current bridal trends, and this spring we will see much more unorthodox approaches from 2023 brides. "Women right now are reconsidering what bridal means,"&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Vera Wang told Hello! Fashion</a> earlier this year.</p><p id=ej5NhmW2CaqN data-wc=62>Referring to the current mood for less formal looks she explained, "I like to think that over the last three decades we played a part in encouraging brides to own who they are and how they want to express themselves and who they want to be.

Dark tendrils framed her face and she also wore long bangs swept over in a side parting. The understated style had a fuss-free air and was accented by glistening drop earrings.</p><p id=eiG7ao91oOg- data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Selena Gomez and Nicola Peltz twin in silver sequin Valentino mini dresses</a></strong></p><p id=eYaiVf3gCBJd data-wc=31>&nbsp;Her makeup felt super glam for a wedding look – a neutral smoky eye and defined arches were accompanied by a wash of peach coloured blush and a delicate scarlet lip.</p><p id=e62zmoecUG1d data-wc=25>If Selena is planning on walking down the aisle anytime in the near future, suffice to say she would make the most picture perfect bride…<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=ewlO0ia6_Xrb data-wc=14><strong>Like this story?<a class=hm-link href=#> Sign up to our Hello!
