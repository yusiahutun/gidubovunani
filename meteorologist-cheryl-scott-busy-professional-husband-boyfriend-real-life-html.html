However, there comes a time in everyone's life when they must settle down.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>It seems like the time might have come for Cheryl as she recently got engaged to her longtime boyfriend. Cheryl, who turns the heat up with her hot chemistry with her&nbsp;co-worker, has finally found a suitable companion.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Professional Commitment; Shares Chemistry With Onscreen Husband</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Cheryl Scott is&nbsp;working&nbsp;on ABC 7's top-rated 10 PM newscast since 1 August 2016. She is&nbsp;seen conveying viewers about the weather in Chicago during the station's 4 PM and 5 PM newscasts. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-198 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>See Also:-&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=follow>Maria LaRosa Over with Pregnant Days with Husband?

Cheryl also mentioned in the news release that she was honored to continue working with Jerry and the rest of the weather team on the 10 PM newscast.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Cheryl shares&nbsp;a glowing chemistry with Jerry; however, the co-workers have never been linked romantically. Further, as Cheryl has always been around rumors of her personal life, not being gossiped about her colleague is probably a blessing for her.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Rumored Dating Life; Mystery Boyfriend</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Cheryl's personal life had always been surrounded by rumors as the paparazzi could not get any confirmation about her dating status.</p><p style=text-align:justify>She was previously linked to Josh Iachelli, the owner of Homeslice Pizza, Lincoln Park and co-owner of&nbsp;The Happy Camper. The speculation had initially started when Josh posted a series of Instagram photos featuring Cheryl. However, the pair never came out exclusively as a couple. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-600 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Read Also:-</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Demi Rose Bio: From Dating DJ Boyfriend To Stunning Measurements Of Instagram Star</a></p><p style=text-align:justify>Later, Cheryl shared a picture of a road trip with a mystery man on 4 July 2015, which raised the suspicion that she was dating another man.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Cheryl celebrates 2015's Independence Day taking a </strong><strong>road trip</strong><strong> with </strong><strong>a mystery</strong><strong> man </strong>(Photo: Cheryl Scott's Instagram) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-601 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span><p style=text-align:justify>However, like the previous gossip, this rumor also turned out to be false when Cheryl revealed her real boyfriend.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Boyfriend-Turned-Fiance; Sky-High Wedding Proposal</h2><p style=text-align:justify>After several baseless rumors, Cheryl finally disclosed the identity of her boyfriend, who turned out to be DJ Dante Deiana.
