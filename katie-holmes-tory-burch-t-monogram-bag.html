February 14 just so happened to fall right at the beginning of fashion month and was probably the busiest, most-packed date of NYFW. One of my favorites of the evening was Tory Burch's show. It took place uptown in a large room with an incredible view of the entire city, and more specifically, a large red "I love Tory" projection on the New Yorker hotel across the street. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Katie Holmes</a> was also there, carrying the perfect date night bag by Tory Burch, of course.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Holmes was all over fashion week, but this outfit in particular felt like something special. Mostly because anyone else in the room whose style I admired — from Devon Lee Carlson to my fashion editor friends — was carrying a similar bag from Tory Burch's newly launched <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="u1=${REQUEST_ID}-${DOC_ID}">T Monogram collection</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Thanks to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="u1=${REQUEST_ID}-${DOC_ID}">the iconic logo monogrammed</a> all over the bag, you can tell it's Tory Burch from a mile away. But it also feels like a fresh departure from the usual. And since Katie Holmes and Devon Lee Carslon both wore one, there's no question that every cool girl will be doing the same come spring.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_4-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Holmes's T Monogram bag doesn't appear to be online just yet, but the rest of the massive T Monogram collection is, with so many different bag styles in the same print. There are even some accessories too, ranging from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="u1=${REQUEST_ID}-${DOC_ID}">a T-adorned sleeping bag boot</a> (move over <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Moon Boots</a>) to a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="u1=${REQUEST_ID}-${DOC_ID}">floral bracelet with T logos</a>. Prices start at $98 for an adorable <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="u1=${REQUEST_ID}-${DOC_ID}">jacquard mini cosmetic case</a> and go up to $798 for a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=5 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="u1=${REQUEST_ID}-${DOC_ID}">jacquard oversized barrel bag</a> that's perfect for travel. Personally, all of my favorites fall somewhere in between.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I haven't been able to stop thinking about the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="u1=${REQUEST_ID}-${DOC_ID}">T Monogram braided studio bag</a> since I laid eyes on it. It looks similar to the bag Holmes wore, but with the addition of extremely fun, molded leather yellow flowers. The studio bag is also a great new Tory Burch style that feels so very '90s, and the chain-accented handle gives me off-duty supermodel vibes. Naturally, Carlson was wearing an iteration of this bag in a different T Monogram colorway at the show.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Everyone needs a fun new bag for spring, and there really is no better choice than one from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="u1=${REQUEST_ID}-${DOC_ID}">Tory Burch's new Monogram collection</a>. It's classic yet different, oh-so-easy to style, and now, Katie Holmes-approved. Consider it a late Valentine's day gift to yourself from the fashion Gods themselves.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Shop the best T Monogram bags, below.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xZqqoaGfo3ysrdOinGagn6G6pr%2BMraarsV2XwrOvx2arZqWfo7yovsCmZJuZlw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./exploring-the-net-worth-wealth-and-fortune-of-shes-the-man-actor-channing-tatum-1296972.html><span>←</span><span>Exploring the Net Worth, Wealth, And Fortune Of ' She's the Man' Actor Channing Tatum</span></a>
