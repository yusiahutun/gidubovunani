Her father is Casey Pearson while her mother is Terri Pearson.&nbsp;</span><span>When she came on the stage of The Voice, season 24, she said she was not just singing for herself but for her family and the whole town where she grew up.</span></p><p><span>Ruby is the first person in her family to bring up the skills of music. </span>Ruby discovered her passion for singing at just nine and a half years old. It all began when she caught her dad enjoying some classic tunes in the car. Intrigued, she started singing along. The first song she ever sang was her dad‚Äôs favorite, a choice that pleased him immensely.</p><p><span>She had lessons and within just three years, she started singing country music from legendary artists such as Billy Don Burns, Johnny Lee, Rhonda Vincent, Lorrie Morgan, Vince Gill, Tony Jackson, Mickey Gilley, and The Risches Family Band.</span></p><h3><b>Career</b></h3><p>Her first taste of performing came unexpectedly at a flea market, where she stumbled upon two musicians. Armed with just six songs, none of which they knew, they suggested she sing a cappella. Ruby took the stage, drawing in a crowd and making an impression. In 2018, she showcased her talent at the World Championship of Performing Arts.</p><p>She clinched a gold medal in the country music category for ages 10-16 and a silver medal in gospel. Notably, she emerged as the overall winner in the country music division. she has also performed at The Voice Kids UK 2020, Indigo @ The O2, & various music venues & festivals across London and the South East.</p><h3><b>The Voice 24</b></h3><p><span>Ruby came on the stage wearing a Western dress and carrying an acoustic guitar. She sang an energetic song, ‚ÄúI Want to Be a Cowboy‚Äôs Sweetheart,‚Äù that was originally performed in 1935. Immediately, the audience grasped the attention towards her and she gained huge stardom in a few minutes.</span></p><p>She received a positive reply from Niall Horan about her energy in the performance. <span>The other judge, Reba McEntire, said that she was feeling proud of the choice of song that Ruby did. She said she was proud of the heritage and the song she chose.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Leigh rocked the Playoffs with ‚ÄúLong, Long Time‚Äù and nailed it in the Live Shows, grabbing a public vote spot singing ‚ÄúYou Lie.‚Äù She aced the Semifinals with ‚ÄúTake Me Home, Country Roads,‚Äù keeping her Coach since day one.&nbsp;</p><p>Other contestants had ups and downs, scoring Saves and Steals before hitting their peak, but Leigh‚Äôs stuck with her original Coach from the start. This consistency puts her in a strong position for the Finals, where is most likely to clinch the crown.&nbsp;</p><table><tbody><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Ruby Leigh Biography</h3></th></tr><tr><td width=40%>Real Name</td><td width=60%>Ruby Leigh</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Date</td><td>2007</td></tr><tr><td>Age (as of 2023)</td><td>16 Years</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Place</td><td>United States</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Singer</td></tr><tr><td>College</td><td>‚Äì</td></tr><tr><td>Qualification</td><td>‚Äì</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Physical Statistics</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>in feet inches&nbsp;<strong>‚Äì 5‚Äô 5‚Äù ‚Äì </strong>in Centimeters <strong>‚Äì 165 cm</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>in Kilograms&nbsp;<strong>‚Äì 56 kg&nbsp; ‚Äì&nbsp; </strong>in Pounds&nbsp;<strong>‚Äì&nbsp; 123 lbs</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Hair Color</td><td>Brown</td></tr><tr><td>Eye Color</td><td>Brown</td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthyspy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ruby-Leigh-2.jpg alt="Ruby Leigh The Voice" width=960 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Family</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Father</td><td>Casey Pearson</td></tr><tr><td>Mother</td><td>Terri Pearson</td></tr><tr><td>Sister</td><td>‚Äì</td></tr><tr><td>Brother</td><td>‚Äì</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Relationship Status</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Marital Status</td><td>Single</td></tr><tr><td>Affair</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Who is her boyfriend?</td><td>None</td></tr></tbody></table><h3><b>Personal Life</b></h3><p><span>Ruby Leigh is only 16 years old and if she had any boyfriend, it is not the appropriate age to talk about this.
