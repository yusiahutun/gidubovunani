Posting a photo of Daniel as well as some snaps showing off his stunning creations at a local pottery fair in June, Alistair wrote: "So proud of my beautiful husband. @thepilgrimpotter This weekend is his first pottery fair.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">Don't miss...</h4><p id=eNgksddUOKF data-wc=25>"At the prestigious @townergallery no less, this weekend!

And the beautiful drag beings are the latest scapegoats of the idiot right? In many countries of the world, it's not legal or safe to be proud of who you are as a queer being.

In one post, he wrote: "My husband Daniel, a yoga teacher and I are offering free meditation and yoga to keep us grounded and happy during these extraordinary times. All welcome."</p><p id=esTtyFw-Aw3 data-wc=42>He added: "I am lucky to have found love and have a very understanding and supportive husband, Daniel... We're currently in a 1930s French sea captain's cottage in the port of Newhaven. And we live there with our very big dog Ben."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/35f42af89fc1-alistair-appleton-and-husband-daniel.jpg><p id=ePbDfvOHNcM data-wc=47>Alistair previously tweeted about his sexuality back in 2017 with a quote which read: "I am glad I am gay and that I suffered bullying for it because it allows me empathy for the bullied everywhere." He posted it with a link to a now-deleted blog post.</p><p id=eO7AhlVkNob data-wc=78>Alistair is a man of many talents and spoke about training to become a psychotherapist back in 2012, telling Hampshire Life: "I loved that work so much that I started to get a bit disenchanted with all the crazy schedules of TV filming and I decided five years ago to re-train as a psychotherapist. That was the best decision of my life and I think I've hit my 40s in much better shape than I hit my 30s."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5uZ25xYGx8pr%2FCmqeeZaSkerW0xGaaqK2eqb%2B6ecyenK1lkaG2tMDAoqlmmaCluabAzqeqZqClqK%2BiusNmm5qmmZq5cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./driver-with-cocaine-threw-gun-from-car-hit-truck-during-davenport-chase-police-allege.html><span>←</span><span>Driver with cocaine threw gun from car, hit truck during Davenport chase, police allege</span></a>
