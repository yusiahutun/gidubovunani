Plus, she’s drop-dead gorgeous, which never hurts.</p><p>Bosworth, who is styled by famed celebrity stylist&nbsp;<strong><a title="Stylist Cher Coulter tells us the one celebrity she thinks could pull off jeans on the red&nbsp;carpet" href=#>Cher Coulter</a>,</strong> has been largely absent at <a href=#>New York Fashion Week</a> this season—she hasn’t been in a single front row—but she did make an appearance at <strong>Guess’ </strong>party last night celebrating their Nashville-inspired Fall 2014 collection. Clad in a modern take on a classic Guess look, denim on denim, Bosworth finished off the look with metallic accessories that included a solid pair of classic pumps. Her endless lineup of sleek <a href=# id=auto-tag_red-carpet-4 data-tag=red-carpet-4>red carpet</a> looks had us wondering: is there anything this style star refuses to wear?</p><p>“I have to say, platform <a href=# id=auto-tag_heels data-tag=heels>heels</a> just really aren’t my thing,” Bosworth told StyleCaster on the red carpet at the event. What she does like to wear: “I really love the masculine minimal approach that’s happening right now, because there’s so much of that in my own style. I enjoy it.”</p><p>While we personally are big fans of platforms, we can’t fault a girl for wanting to keep it sleek at all times—something Bosworth excels at better than anyone!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kate-bosworth.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xZqqoaGfo3ykscuemauhpK56rbvOpKpoamJthHqDjqSYrZ1dl7y0w86rq6Flo6nGrbGO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kate-moss-portrait.html><span>←</span><span>Kate bares all in National Portrait Gallery shots</span></a>
