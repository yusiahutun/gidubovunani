(Awkward.) Jay-Z performed on the Grammys stage for the first time since 2014 last night — and though he didn’t storm the Recording Academy and take back what is rightfully Beyoncé’s Album of the Year Award, he did perform his extended verse in “God Did” with DJ Khaled, John Legend, Lil Wayne, Fridayy, and Rick Ross. Under royal-purple lights, the crew of mostly older hip-hop giants rapped their verses on a set outside L.A.’s Crypto.com Arena, seated behind a Last Supper–esque table overflowing with produce. For some (in the Beyhive), despite the opulent staging, it was tough to endure the optimistic song moments after the disaster that was the Album of the Year presentation. If we were Beyoncé’s husband, we simply would’ve flipped the table.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>“God Did” live at the 65th Grammy Awards performed by <a href=#>@DJKhaled</a>, JAY-Z (<a href=#>@sc</a>), <a href=#>@JohnLegend</a>, <a href=#>@LilTunechi</a>, <a href=#>@RickRoss</a>, and <a href=#>@Fridayy</a>. <a href=#>#Grammys</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/gmAOZcW5T4</a></p>— Roc Nation (@RocNation) <a href=#>February 6, 2023</a><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cldsy7hxa000s3b6v0zxn7z7e@published data-word-count=138>Both Hov and Lil Tunechi have had beef with the Grammys in the past. As recently as 2021, the “6 Foot 7 Foot” rapper said, “Fuck the Grammys,” and questioned the legitimacy of the voting body after he wasn’t nominated or invited to that year’s ceremony. “As an artist, when I see da Grammys coming up & I’m not involved nor invited; I wonder. Is it me , my musik, or just another technicality?” Lil Wayne <a href=#>tweeted</a> at the time. “I look around w respect & wonder competitively am I not worthy?!” Jay-Z boycotted the Grammys over DMX’s snub in 1999 and did not return to the show until 2004. After the jump scare that was Harry Styles winning Album of the Year over Beyoncé at last night’s Scammys Grammys, perhaps they’ll be inspired to boycott once again.</p><h2 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h2><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cldsc7yjz000k0peuo61dm3y3@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>The Highs, Lows, and Whoas, of the 2023 Grammy Awards</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clds11rer00000pe4bbbciuuh@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Beyoncé Grants Grammys the Ability to Call Her Their Most Awarded Artist</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clds885w500000pel5uwydxxe@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>The Grammys Pay Tribute to 50 Years of Hip-Hop</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clds24fib00000pec1wqf3lgw@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Quavo Brought Takeoff’s Chain to the Grammys</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Who Got Jay-Z to Perform at the Grammys? ‘God Did.’</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlpbGdgZ3yovsCmpLKrXZ%2BuunnZZqOipF2srrq6xGannqqWpL%2Burc2cnGegpKK5</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ap-rotting-bodies-fake-ashes-and-sold-body-parts-push-colorado-to-patch-lax-funeral-home-rules.html><span>←</span><span>Rotting bodies, fake ashes and sold body parts push Colorado to patch lax funeral home rules</span></a>
