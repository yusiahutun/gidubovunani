The <a href=#>celebrity</a>‘s impact has been steadily rising over the past few years. From demanding more royalties from <a href=#>Spotify</a> to <a href=#>re-recording her albums</a> to own the masters. The singer has a clear head. But before she bumped into <a href=#>Travis Kelce</a> – or he called her out on blast – the NFL star was making waves of his own. Swifties have been swooning over the <a href=#>celebrity couple</a>, and they’ve come to a conclusion.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-travis-kelce-s-positive-reputation-before-he-met-taylor-swift>Travis Kelce’s positive reputation before he met Taylor Swift</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/04/GettyImages-1736565364-1024x818.jpg><p>The <a href=#>Super Bowl</a> champ earned his own rings before even considering buying one for his beau, that’s for sure. Even more so, he said it himself ahead of the big game earlier this year.</p><p>But ever since he’s struck up a relationship with fellow 34-year-old Tay Tay and they exchanged <a href=#>friendship bracelets</a>, every aspect of his life has been broadcast to millions of more people.</p><p>Whenever the <a href=#>New Heights</a> co-host steps out in public new videos emerge on TikTok, paparazzi follow his whereabouts and sometimes his name is trending on Twitter – especially if <a href=#>he heads out to Coachella with Taylor Swift</a>.</p><p>Despite extra eyes and lens fixated on the star, Swifties are coming to the conclusion Travis Kelce’s reputation is still intact.</p><p>One fan account posted their thoughts: “Travis kelce’s life has been put through a microscope these past eight months, and we still haven’t heard a single negative story about him. 10 years in the <a href=#>NFL</a> and a short-lived reality career, and there’s been no expose, no blind items. Do you understand how rare that is?”</p><p>And boy, did it cause a discussion.</p><p>The tweet was liked 15,000 times and seen more than 1.1 million.</p><p>And most Swifties agreed.</p><p>One wrote: “‘Rare‘ is an appropriate description of Travis Kelce because while the dude is a beast of a baller and frigging funny as hell, he’s lightning in a bottle is that he truly sincerely likes people… not for ego or gain, the dude just likes people.”</p><p>A second added: “I agree that he seems to have led a pretty scandal free life, but it shouldn’t be that surprising, most people are good. That doesn’t mean he’s perfect though, no one is, we shouldn’t have unrealistic expectations for him, he’s allowed to be human”.</p><p>But others threw out the idea of perspective. One said: “No there’s plenty, y’all just choose to ignore every negative thing about him that doesn’t fit your narrative.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-travis-plan-before-he-met-taylor>Travis’ plan before he met Taylor</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/04/GettyImages-1951120246-1024x683.jpg><p>Years before his Love Story began with the <a href=#>Grammy</a>-award winner, his management team had sat down to make a plan to push him into further stardom.</p><p>Travis, who has been managed by Andre and Aaron Eanes since his early days after <a href=#>graduating from college</a>, had his sights on the stars.</p><p>The A&A Management duo, who took on Trav as their second-ever client when he was studying at the University of Cincinnati, wanted him to be big – like really big.</p><p>In 2023, after his second Super Bowl win, he went on to <a href=#>host and star in Saturday Night Live</a> within just a few weeks. He also starred in seven high-profile commercials, and helped his sportswear brand get more action.</p><p>Dating the singer-songwriter wasn’t a ‘plan’ or in the cards, it was just life.</p><p>“People say to me, ‘Man, it’s been a crazy year,’” Aaron explained previously over people implying Taylor’s impact on Travis Kelce’s reputation and fame.</p><p>“When I say, ‘Actually, it’s not that crazy,’ people look at me funny. It’s because it’s easy when you have a plan. We’re executing that plan.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-nfl-star-s-future>NFL star’s future</h2><p>Although brother <a href=#>Jason Kelce has stepped down</a> from his time as Philadelphia Eagles’ center, Travis is still in the game.</p><p>A lot of speculation arose over Travis Kelce retiring after <a href=#>Jason Kelce</a>‘s emotional press conference last month. But the athlete still has two more seasons at least on his contract that’ll see him through until 2026.</p><p>And what will happen after that?</p><p>Considering <a href=#>Travis’ is set to host a new TV show</a> – Are You Smarter Than A Celebrity? – he could sidestep into the world of showbiz. He already hinted he’d love to work on movies after someone said he looked like he <a href=#>stepped out of a Wes Anderson film</a>.</p><p>The tight end is holding his aspirations close to his chest. He’s the only one to know All Too Well what he wants to do next.</p><p>One thing for sure, having fans feel his reputation is almost squeaky clean is just a plus for Travis Kelce. It could help him win an Oscar one day.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlsX2aDcMDRmq2iq12gsq2vxGaamqScmrFuuMign62mmaO0brXNZphmmp%2Bpwa2xjKitnqpdnba0ec%2BroKysmaOybr7EqaytmaSevK97</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./place-of-hopes-new-horizons.html><span>←</span><span>Place of Hopes New Horizons</span></a>
