When you decide to live alone, there are a number of aspects you have to consider, like good, healthy, and nutritious food, your other daily chores, and much more. For senior citizens, the number of things to look after is double that of a regular person. First things first, they can need immediate medical attention at any given point in time. And as the body and mind age, it can also put them at risk of increased mental and health diseases.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Featuring for the cover story of The Enterprise World’s this issue of Enterprising Companies of the Year is The W Group Assisted Living Communities, a company that is dedicated to promoting an independent lifestyle to senior citizens.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Company-</h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>The W Group </a>Assisted Living Communities is one of the largest adult home/ALP organizations in New York State. Almost 10 years ago, Berry Weiss realized that residents throughout the state needed a safe compassionate, and caring place to live when they could no longer remain alone in their homes. The mission became to build communities that would be able to simulate an at-home care facility that could assist its residents with daily activities such as dressing, bathing, medications, and meals all within a safe and caring environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“We started The W Group Assisted Living communities with 3 facilities located within the 5 boroughs. Today, we own and manage 30 facilities in New York and Florida.”&nbsp;</p><p>The success of The W Group Assisted Living Communities is based on the motto that “Our residents come first” and absolutely no kind of expense is spared to see to it that they are well cared for and safe. Every member of the company is completely dedicated to it, and not just because it has turned out to be a bigger venture, but it is because of the fact that every employee is committed to working for the betterment of society, in every way possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“I feel a deep responsibility to our care for thousands of caregivers and administrative staff.”&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Services that Set The W Group Assisted Living Communities Apart-</h3><p>While The W Group Assisted Living Communities does not sell any products, caring, compassionate and quality service is a focus of the company’s policies.&nbsp; As mentioned before, the care of the residents is the company’s most important concern.&nbsp; In deciding to invest in another community, look at ways in which one can improve the quality of life for the residents in the community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“Whether it is investing in the infrastructure of the building or simply providing them with recreational and improved physical care, our goal is still the same – “Our Residents Come First”.”</p><p>The company believes that its residents should live an independent lifestyle, where they can determine how they go about their daily life and make their own choices.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Assisted Living&nbsp;</h3><p>Each of the communities strives to allow the residents to maintain their independence while receiving the discreet assistance they require. The company’s degree of care is tailored to each individual situation and is backed by industry-leading quality standards.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Adult Care Services&nbsp;</h3><p>The company nurtures the mind, body, and spirit of the residents by taking care of their physical needs, providing opportunities for social interaction, and offering a wide range of programs and activities based on individual preferences.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Medical Services&nbsp;</h3><p>The W Group’s Assisted Living Communities highly trained Physicians and Specialists treat every patient based on their individualized clinical needs.

A number years ago they opened Preferred Homecare of Florida and are rapidly expanding their base throughout southern Florida.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The W Group Assisted Living Communities became a <a href=#>natural extension of my health care</a> journey.&nbsp; And at this time their success has far exceeded even my wildest expectations.&nbsp; Over time he has built a rather unique relationship with The W Group Assisted Living Communities employees.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“My door is always open and our management team is constantly rewarding our employees with opportunities for growth and advancement within the company.”&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Experiences that Shaped the Company-&nbsp;</h3><p>One rather unique experience that shows a lot about The W Group Assisted Living Communities was when we had an unexpected emergency in one of our Adirondack communities.&nbsp; Members of our management teams drove up to the Adirondack facility and worked throughout the night alongside the facility staff and members of the DOH to ensure all of the residents were safely moved along with their possessions and medications to one of our nearby sister communities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>The Promise of The W Group Assisted Living Communities-&nbsp;</h3><p>“For several years, The W Group Assisted Living Communities have allowed residents across New York and Florida to create invaluable memories.

Our passion is healthcare, and our vision is to always put our residents first.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqyr8DEq6eroaOaxLC%2By51lnKedZMGpsYywZKCqn6q9brzRqKSorJmjtG64yJ%2BcrKypobI%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rod-stewart-grabs-breakfast-with-penny-lancaster-amid-coronavirus.html><span>←</span><span>Rod Stewart Wears Gloves While Having Breakfast With Wife Penny Lancaster Amid Coronavirus Outbreak</span></a>
