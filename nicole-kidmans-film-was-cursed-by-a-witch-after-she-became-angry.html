I didn’t want the vibe.”</p><p>The person in question, who has not been named, was hired as a witch consultant to get the details of the ceremony for the film.&nbsp;Dunne said she was “very, very helpful,” and they “got along great.”</p><p>He claims she was ‘handsomely’ paid by Warner Bros, and he put her up in a nice hotel in LA to meet Nicole Kidman and Sandra Bullock who were ‘dying to meet her.’</p><p>“When the producer called, she was greatly offended and wanted&nbsp;three gross points&nbsp;[from the film’s profit]. She wanted to publish a&nbsp;Practical Magic&nbsp;cookbook and reportedly said: “You can’t buy me off with a hotel.”</p><p>“She left a curse in some sort of tongue on my voicemail – that was quite chilling, actually – and threatened to sue Warner Bros,” he told the publication.</p><p>Dunne then claims he took the recording to the legal department, who allegedly said “f*** this” before writing her a check.</p><p>When asked if the curse had any effects on the set or the cast, Griffin explained how a crew member’s elderly father died of a heart attack before shooting.</p><p>Everybody then said “it was the witch”.
