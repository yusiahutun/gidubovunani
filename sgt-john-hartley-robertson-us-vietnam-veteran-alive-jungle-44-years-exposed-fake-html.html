He was the third of five children born to John Cheslea and Mildred Robertson.</span></li><li><span>He grew up during World War II, and it was this influence that led him to drop out of high school at 17 so he could get his GED and join the Army, according to the film makers.</span></li><li><span>He went on to join the U.S. Army Special Forces, known as the Green Berets, and was later chosen to join an elite Special Operations Group known as Military Assistance Command, Vietnam – Studies and Observations Group (MACV-SOG).</span></li><li><span>On May 20, 1968, he was on a mission when his helicopter came under enemy fire and crashed. A full search mission was not possible and he was declared Missing in Action. On April 28, 1976, he was officially declared dead by the military, leaving behind a wife, Wanda Robertson, and two daughters.</span></li></ul><p><span>According to best selling author and former special forces soldier Don Bendell, the individual who claims to be Sgt.

Robertson since 1982.<br></span></p><p><span>Senior members of the special forces veterans community have also made it clear to the MailOnline their disgust at the man's claims expressed through the new documentary.</span></p><p><span>It is thought that the individual </span><span>has possibly scammed tens of thousands of dollars from well meaning veterans who want to believe him.<br></span></p><p><span>Indeed, Mr. Bendell reveals that influential former POWs Major Mark 'Zippo' Smith and Orson Swindle - who was Senator John McCain's cellmate during their incarceration by North Vietnamese forces - are aware of the fraud the man claiming to be Sgt.
