They found that Billy was born with a heart disease."&nbsp;</p><p id=ev9cNjd0lP data-wc=26>He added: "Basically, the pulmonary valve was completely blocked, and he has a hole in the wall between the left and right sides of his heart."&nbsp;</p><p id=e10u80dLxo data-wc=22>Billy is now "doing great" and each birthday, his dad shares how "grateful" he and Molly are for their son's improved health.&nbsp;</p><h2>Who is Jimmy Kimmel's wife?&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a6ee58c16a28-jimmy-kimmel-wife-molly.jpg><p id=eLoH6fgTSM data-wc=34>Molly is an executive producer and co-head writer on his talk show, She also worked on the Primetime Emmy Awards and executive produced the Oscars in March 2023, which Jimmy hosted.&nbsp;</p><p id=e-JiNlO25ua data-wc=26>They worked together for six years before their relationship turned romantic.

I was also the only female writer in the room at the time, and I didn't want to change the dynamic," she explained.</p><p id=eoNbTap9SK data-wc=48>"We love to make fun of Jimmy over here, myself included. When you have camaraderie with your co-workers, one of the parts of that is making fun of the boss a little bit, and now to think, That's the guy I'm dating, I didn't want that to stop."&nbsp;</p><p id=eJpzZMVB5x data-wc=25>After three years of dating, Jimmy popped the question in South Africa's Kruger National Park.
