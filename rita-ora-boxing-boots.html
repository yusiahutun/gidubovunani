Back in 2010, Miu Miu's resort show blended sportswear with beachwear, and similar boots were on the agenda.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/dce0352c215d-screenshot-2023-07-28-134154.jpg><p id=eFA1_Ha-YmF data-wc=52>More recently, <a class=hm-link href=#>Mia Regan channelled her inner David Beckham&nbsp;</a>by wearing Miu Miu's metallic silver football boot heels with a pair of jeans and a vest top. Just your casual Saturday outfit, right? Rita gave the ensemble a 2023 <a class=hm-link href=#>quiet luxury&nbsp;</a>makeover, by wearing an all-white ensemble without a logo in sight.</p><p id=enMZB8B7l6 data-wc=43>If Rita was trying to prove that even the most feminine of dresses pair with her bizarre boots, this was definitely the brand to do so with. Brand<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;founder Rebecca Hessen-Cohen told</a>earlier this year &nbsp;“It's like the ultimate Girls Club."&nbsp;</p><p id=eIDlDPHHThQ data-wc=39>"The LoveShackFancy girl is very romantic, beautiful, sexy, confident and fun," she explained, "a lot of these pieces are designed to just throw on and dance in. They make you bring out your super feminine side. That's the idea." &nbsp;</p><p id=eH72yTfkZE data-wc=29>Is this a trend fashion fans would welcome back with open arms? We're not sure. But Rita certainly schooled us in how to style the boots if it does.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbOue5Nyb3BxYGS%2FqsDAZqarmV2XvLm1zaBkm6efqcBw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./angela-kinsey-stood-her-ground-to-have-insensitive-joke-written-out-the-office.html><span>←</span><span>Angela Kinsey stood her ground to have 'insensitive' joke written out The Office</span></a>
