But Marquita Pring has admitted that her body is still not quite curvy enough for some of the clients that hire her.</span></p><p><span>The 21-year-old, who has appeared in campaigns for Levi's and Evans, and even walked the catwalk for Jean Paul Gaultier, revealed in an interview today how she sometimes pads her hips to make them look larger on photo shoots.</span></p><p><span>She told WWD: </span><span>'Some [clients] like you much smaller, [U.S.] size 10, size 8. Some people would prefer a 14 or 16. So for me, I’m right in the middle at a sort of small 14, high 12. So I pad sometimes since I’ve got clients who would prefer a solid 14 or 16.</span></p><p><span>When asked to elaborate, she admitted that she probably shouldn't be dishing on such tricks of the trade.<br></span></p><p><span>'I don’t know if we should reveal this secret! They’re pieces of foam. So I just lay them flat on each hip underneath [hosiery]. They’re like a solid inch and a half thick... [and] make you seem all around wider.</span></p><p><span>'From the side you look kind of weird - and it feels weird. Like every now and then my arm gets caught on it and I’m like, wait, this isn’t me. But it’s better for me because I can still be healthy and work out and have the body I want. It’s a little bit of model magic.'</span></p><p><span>Miss Pring, </span><span>who is from Clinton in Upstate New York, </span><span>has been modelling since the age of 15</span><span>, but describes a recent shoot for Vogue Italia as a career highlight.<br></span></p><p><span>She revealed that she almost missed her chance to take part, though, because she had been travelling in South Africa without a phone.</span></p><p><span>'My agency practically hunted me down,' she recalled. '...they told me that Steven Meisel wanted me for Italian Vogue and that they’d been trying to find me for the past four days and I had to get on the absolute next flight back to New York or else I was going to miss it.'</span></p><h2>RELATED ARTICLES</h2><ul class="rotator-pages link-xocc"><li class=rotator-prev><a href=# data-page=prev>Previous</a></li><li><a href=# data-page=1>1</a></li><li class=rotator-next><a href=# data-page=next>Next</a></li></ul><ul class="rotator-panels link-bogr1 linkro-ccox"><li><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/07/25/article-2018731-0D29A08200000578-329_87x84.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>Secrets of an A-list body: How to get Jennifer Aniston's decolletage</span></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/07/25/article-2018609-0D29A17E00000578-740_87x84.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>Get ready for some hip action: Why the peplum is set to be fashion's next big thing</span></a></li></ul><h2>Share this article</h2><span class=wai>Share</span><p><span>She also said that the plus-size modelling world is more close-knit and friendly than the so-called 'straight-size' industry because the community is smaller.<br></span></p><p><span>But as for the term 'plus-size' itself, she believes it should be phased out altogether.</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/03/04/article-1363152-0D795605000005DC-560_468x669.jpg height=669 width=468 alt="Marquita Pring" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Control: The model revealed that it was important to her clients that her weight doesn't fluctuate too much, and that exercise and a healthy diet was essential</p><p><span>In an interview with New York magazine in March, she said: </span><span>'I think we need to phase out the category "plus-size models."
