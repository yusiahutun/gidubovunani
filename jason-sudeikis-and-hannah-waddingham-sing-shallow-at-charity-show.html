Sudeikis – the host of <a href=#>Thundergong!</a>, a night of musical performances and laughs benefiting the Steps of Faith Foundation – was first on stage with his former<a href=#> Saturday Night Live</a> castmate, <a href=#><strong>Will Forte</strong></a>, when he said, “There is nobody I would rather sing this song with.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Ted-Lasso-s-Jason-Sudeikis-and-Hannah-Waddingham-Channel-Bradley-Cooper-and-Lady-Gaga-on-Shallow-Duet-027.jpg><p>Sudeikis and Forte began to sing the Oscar-winning song, with Jason taking singing Cooper’s part. When Forte, 53, attempted to do his best Gaga impression, Waddingham’s voice echoed throughout the theater. She walked out and took it from there, delivering a duet with Sudeikis that would give Jack and Ally — Cooper and Gaga’s characters — a run for their money.</p><p>This performance was not just for all those fans missing Ted Lasso now that the series has seemingly concluded. Thundergong! raises funds to help uninsured and underinsured amputees get the prosthetic limbs they need. In 2022, Thundergong! raised more than $600,000 for Steps of Faith, bringing the then-six-year total to more than $2.1 million.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Ted-Lasso-s-Jason-Sudeikis-and-Hannah-Waddingham-Channel-Bradley-Cooper-and-Lady-Gaga-on-Shallow-Duet-028.jpg><p>Waddingham will have another chance to show off her singing talents on November 22 when Hannah Waddingham: Home For Christmas drops on Apple TV+. The holiday extravaganza will feature Waddingham performing some festive classics, along with some special appearances by <strong>Luke Evans</strong>,<strong> Leslie Odom Jr.</strong>,<strong> Sam Ryder</strong> and more.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Ted Lasso’s third season concluded in May, ending in a way indicating the award-winning series has ended. However, it might not be entirely over. “I genuinely don’t know,” <strong>Nick Mohammed</strong> exclusively <a href=#>told Us Weekly </a>in July 2022. Mohammed, 43, played Nathan Shelley on Ted Lasso and said there might be more of the show in the future.</p><p>“They’ve been very open about saying when they created the show, they had mapped out three-season arcs for the chief players,” the actor said, “but that’s quite common, I think, for a show to have longevity and so on when you’re pitching a show. Genuinely, who knows? It might just have a break <a href=#>and then come back</a>, or it might be the end, but I don’t know.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKGaq5%2BjerTBw56gpKGjYq6vsIyhmKemkZ16uK3DnaCnn5iWum6%2FyKeeZquYlrmtu9ZmmK1lk52us7XTsmSsoJ%2BsfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./caitlyn-jenners-height-weight-and-body-measurements.html><span>←</span><span>Caitlyn Jenners Height, Weight And Body Measurements</span></a>
