"I spoke to her twice before, and we came to an understanding. But she kept it going."</p><p>After seeing Minaj had allegedly liked a tweet criticizing Cardi's abilities as a mom -- something Nicki denies -- she couldn't hold it in any more.</p><p>"I was going to make millions off my Bruno Mars tour, and I sacrificed that to stay with my daughter," Cardi explained. "I love my daughter. I'm a good-ass f--king mom. So for somebody that don't have a child to like that comment?"</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:6671d1ef-8db8-5230-8d27-e983f26d162e data-container-ref=toofab:article:cf918e50-1607-5ab2-9f43-6621ce838b9f data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/9d/5by4/2018/09/10/9df023a8e0985fe8810547083cffc35f_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Nicki Minaj Calls Cardi B Fight 'Mortifying and Humiliating,' Says She Needs an 'Intervention'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>On her Queen Radio show, Minaj said it was "mortifying" to be confronted in such a way "in front of upper echelon people who are, you know, people who have their lives together." But Cardi defended her choice to do it then and there.</p><p>"So many people want to say that party wasn't the time or the place," she said, "but I'm not going to catch another artist in the grocery store or down the block."</p><p>The "Bodak Yellow" singer also spilled on some fitting advice she received from <strong><a href=#>Kris Jenner</a></strong> during a hang out at the momager's home with Corey Gamble, <strong><a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a></strong> and <strong><a href=#>Kanye West</a></strong>.</p><p>"Kris told me, 'People are going to talk badly about you, but it doesn't really matter as long as you're making money,'" Cardi recalled. "And it's true. If you read the online comments, it seems like everybody hates the Kardashians. Each and every one of them. But how can that be true if everything they sell sells out?"</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:c3517c38-74ef-5542-bc93-097b202059d1 data-container-ref=toofab:article:cf918e50-1607-5ab2-9f43-6621ce838b9f data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/2f/5by4/2018/09/27/2fcc92db072e5e5c92188389a9826134_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Bravo/Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Naomi Campbell Throws Major Shade at Nicki Minaj, Cardi B and Kendall Jenner on 'WWHL'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>A lot of the nasty comments Cardi sees are usually in relation to her marriage to Offset, who has been the target of many a cheating rumor.</p><p>"Every single day there's rumors about me and my dude," she told the magazine. "And it almost drives me crazy, because I start to believe them. I don't have no proof. I don't have receipts. But I just got to know my man. We practically on the phone 24 hours a day. If I can't find him, I'm going to find his friend. Somebody going to answer the phone. But I cannot be feeling insecure, to a point that I would drive my dude away, because these people want that to happen."</p><p>She added that they've both changed their ways when it comes to what they rap about and how they shoot their music videos.</p><p>"I can't rap about certain things, because I don't want to insult my husband. And when I want to do a music video, I can't use a male model and do crazy things," she said, adding that it goes both ways. "He knows better than to do certain things in music videos. I'll beat his ass."</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/3d/o/2018/10/09/3d957be1a8315cd58935d869da08b146_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit image-block__media-credit">Mickalene Thomas</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlfnl7kGlmaXFfmK6zsMhmmWammZi4qnnMoqWaol2jsrh52KippGWWlsCptc6nZLCdlaB6p7XGoato</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brooklyn-beckham-first-job-coffee-shop.html><span>←</span><span>Brooklyn Beckham reportedly takes on job at coffee shop</span></a>
