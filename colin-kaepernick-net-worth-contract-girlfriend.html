Netflix had just teased the first look for its upcoming Colin Kaepernick limited series Colin In Black and White during Sunday’s 73rd&nbsp;Annual Emmy Awards.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Colin Kaepernick’s Netflix Series ‘Colin In Black And White’ First Look Debuted</strong></span></h2><p><span>The much anticipated upcoming Netflix limited series ‘Colin in Black and White’ had its first look debut at the 73rd&nbsp;annual Emmy Awards. The six-episode scripted drama is a real-life based event and coming of age series directed from collaborations of acclaimed filmmaker Ava DuVernay, and NFL quarterback turned activist Colin Kaepernick. Netflix described the series by saying, <strong>“You don’t know Kaepernick until you know Colin.”</strong></span></p><p><span>The story promises to take audiences on a powerful journey where the first look starts with Colin’s narration,</span></p><p><strong><span>“Let me share a story that’s not told enough. While I was in high school, I still had a lot to learn about the way the world works. But you know what? I wouldn’t trade those moments for anything.”</span></strong></p><p><span>The limited series is set to premiere on 29 October that showcases Kaepernick’s coming of age, tackling the obstacles of race, class, and culture as the black adopted child of a white family in Central California. The story progresses as high school Colin played by Jaden Michael, faces adversity in his journey of becoming an All-Pro Quarterback for the San-Francisco 49ers and later a cultural icon and an activist.</span></p><p><strong><span>See This:&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>All About Colin Powell's Wife Alma Powell - Check Out Her Biography</a></span></strong></p><p><span>The new teaser reveals Nick Offerman and Mary Louise Parker as Colin’s adoptive parents Rick and Teresa Kaepernick. The first episode is directed by DuVernay, and Robert Townsend, Sheldon Candis, Kristi Williams, and Kenny Leon will subsequently direct the other episodes. Ava DuVernay and Michael Starrbury, along with Colin Kaepernick, will serve as executive producers.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Activist Colin Kaepernick's Net Worth & Salary&nbsp;</strong></span></h2><p><span>The activist Colin Kaepernick is an amazing and talented athlete who caught massive attention when he knelt down during the national anthem during NFL games in protest of police brutality and racial inequality in the United States. The gifted athlete, Colin, is an American football player who has an estimated <a href=# rel=noopener>net worth</a> of $20 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.</span></p><p><span>It is reported that he had earned more than $43 million during his six seasons in NFL between 2011 and 2016. He had $14.3 million as a peak NFL salary during the 2016 season.</span></p><p><span>Kaepernick had first<a href=# rel=noopener> signed a four-year</a> $5.1 million contract where his annual salary was $1.2 million. Then after four years, he signed a six-year, $114 million contracts with the San Francisco 49ers, where he had $61 million guaranteed money. Later it was found that the guaranteed money was only in case of a career-ending injury. Over six years, he had total earnings of about $43.4 million.</span></p><p><span>It was reported that Colin received less than one-third of his $126 million contracts which he signed before 2014. Colin had his salary cut down by $2 million each year if he wasn’t named first or second-team All pro.</span></p><p><span>Kaepernick opted out of his contract in early March, hoping to take advantage of becoming a free agent as he knew the 49ers were going to release him later in the summer of 2017. In the end, Colin had received $39.4 million from the deal, which was<a href=# rel=noopener> about 31% of the total</a> most people touted.</span></p><p><span>Colin Kaepernick was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on 3 November 1987 to a 19-year-old single mother. Later he was adopted by white parents that made him a bi-racial child facing curious racist folks. He started football at the age of 8 and continued his passion. He was selected by the San Francisco 49ers in the second round of the 2011 NFL draft while he was in college.</span></p><p><span>After the second year, the dazzling quarterback Colin led several big wins earning him a permanent quarterback position. He had a shoulder injury in 2015.</span></p><p><span><strong>Read More:&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Who Is Lucien Laviscount? Bio Details & Dating Life</a></strong></span></p><p><span>Colin had signed his first Nike endorsement deal back in 2011 and has continued to support him all along with the legal battles. Kaepernick had featured on an ad campaign of Nike’s 30th&nbsp;anniversary with the words,<strong> “Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything.”</strong></span></p><p><span>As per the reports of Yahoo NFL reporter, it’s revealed that Nike is still paying Colin a contract that’s par with current star athletes, millions per year that include royalties on a Kaepernick-branded apparel line as he added that he is eventually a brand ambassador of the band.</span></p><p><span>Colin has won two awards for his activism. He was honored with Eason Monroe Courageous Advocate Award at the ACLU of Southern California’s annual Bill of Rights dinner on 3 December. He also earned Sports Illustrated’s Muhammad Ali Legacy Award, which is provided to the former athletes and sports figures who embody the ideals of sportsmanship, leadership, and philanthropy as transportations for changing the world for the better.</span></p><p><span>Colin Kaepernick stood for Black people’s rights in a preseason game’s National anthem session by sitting down in August of 2016. He had shared in an interview that, <strong>“I’m not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses Black people and people of color.”</strong> He concluded that he would continue to sit during the national anthem until seeing<strong> “significant change”</strong> for minorities.</span></p><p><span>This act led Colin to become a free agent at the end of the season and became a man without a team at the beginning of the 2017 NFL season. The issue became a hot political topic with then US President Donald Trump getting involved by calling for kneeling NFL players to be fired during a rally in Alabama. His actions had him both supporters and condemnations from fellow NFL players, politicians, and celebrities.</span></p><p><span>On 15 October 2017, Kaepernick <a href=# rel=noopener>filed a grievance against NFL</a> owners for collusion that stated,</span></p><p><span><strong>“NFL and its owners have colluded to deprive Mr. Kaepernick of employment rights in retaliation for Mr Kaepernick’s leadership and advocacy for equality and social justice and his bringing awareness to peculiar institutions still undermining racial equity in the United States.”</strong></span></p><p><span>The former athlete had provided sufficient evidence to support his claims so that an arbitrator denied the NFL’s request to dismiss Kaepernick’s grievance on 30 August 2018. Finally, the two sides announced that they had agreed to a confidential settlement leading to a sudden conclusion on 15 February.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Colin Kaepernick's Girlfriend, Nessa Diab, Is A Great Support To Him</strong></span></h2><p><span>Nessa Diab is the girlfriend of a former athlete, Colin Kaepernick, 40, who is an American TV and radio host. She comes from a family of an Egyptian Father and a Middle Eastern Mother in Southern California with two brothers. She got her degree in Mass Communication from the University of California, Berkeley.</span></p><p><strong><span>You May Like:&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>David Beckham's Father Ted Beckham Married Millionaire Solicitor Hilary Meredith| His Family Details</a></span></strong></p><p><span>The pair have been together for 6 six years, having started dating in 2015. They both believe in equal rights for people and have worked bringing and raising awareness towards social injustice.</span></p><p><span>When Colin was named Citizen of the Year by GQ’s in 2017, Diab poured her heart out on <a href=# rel=noopener>adding his worthiness of the honor.</a> She wrote,</span></p><p><strong><span>“Colin has always been helping people, he has always been involved, because he has empathy. Empathy was the reason why he was adopted: His parents- two of their children had passed away from heart defects. It's why he helped so many young children with heart defects get proper care- he’s been doing that for years. I’m very fortunate that I have Colin next to me. It’s everything. We love each other, we care for each other and we have to remind that, hey we’re doing our part, we’re trying to make a difference.”</span></strong></p><p><span>Colin Kaepernick’s girlfriend couldn’t keep calm when NFL listed him as retired and <a href=# rel=noopener>called them out</a> on Twitter, tagging commissioner Roger Goodell, and the NFLPA for lying about Kaepernick’s status.</span></p><p><strong><span>You May Like:&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Explore Tamzin Outhwaite's Net Worth, Daughter, Relationship, & Parents Details</a></span></strong></p><p><span>Later on, they changed the <strong>“retired”</strong> tag to <strong>“UFA,”</strong>&nbsp;unrestricted free agent. His girlfriend then thanked everyone for helping get his status on the website.</span></p><p><span>Her beliefs and actions perfectly align with Kaepernick’s philosophy, and together they have founded the Know Your Rights Campaign, where the program encourages youths and empowers them on their education rights when dealing with law enforcement.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6CzZpOkunC%2Fz6ipratfmLyttc1mopqdoJq%2Fr7XCpGSnnaRixLC%2B06FknKeeqb%2Bir9NmnqKqnJu%2FqrHNnQ%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcolin-kaepernick-net-worth-contract-girlfriend.html&text=Colin%20Kaepernicks%20Netflix%20Series%20Colin%20In%20Black%20And%20White%20First%20Look%20Debuted&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcolin-kaepernick-net-worth-contract-girlfriend.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcolin-kaepernick-net-worth-contract-girlfriend.html&title=Colin%20Kaepernicks%20Netflix%20Series%20Colin%20In%20Black%20And%20White%20First%20Look%20Debuted" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcolin-kaepernick-net-worth-contract-girlfriend.html&title=Colin%20Kaepernicks%20Netflix%20Series%20Colin%20In%20Black%20And%20White%20First%20Look%20Debuted" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcolin-kaepernick-net-worth-contract-girlfriend.html&title=Colin%20Kaepernicks%20Netflix%20Series%20Colin%20In%20Black%20And%20White%20First%20Look%20Debuted" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcolin-kaepernick-net-worth-contract-girlfriend.html&description=Colin%20Kaepernicks%20Netflix%20Series%20Colin%20In%20Black%20And%20White%20First%20Look%20Debuted" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./dream-on-hidden-room-jefferson-choices.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Cyberpunk 2077 Dream On - Hidden Room, Jefferson Choices">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./what-happened-to-project-pollo-after-shark-tank-explained.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What happened to Project Pollo after Shark Tank, explained">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
