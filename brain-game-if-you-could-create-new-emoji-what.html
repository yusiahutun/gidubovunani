I want to create a “ping on” bun emoji. The “ping on” bun is a symbol of the Cheung Chau Da Jiu Festival, which is famous for its floats, parades, and lion dances, ending with the “bun scrambling” competition at midnight."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Plastic waste makes up 80 per cent of all marine pollution, according to research. The fish eat the plastic, and then we eat the fish. It is not good for our health.

The pandemic has been affecting our daily lives for nearly three years. Usually, people use an emoji depicting a face behind a mask or one featuring bacteria to symbolise the pandemic.
