Although The Real Housewives of Orange County technically came first, the diamond-clad women over in Beverly Hills have become the face of the franchise ever since blinding us with their bedazzled dollar bills in 2010. And speaking of faces of a franchise, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Kyle Richards</strong></a> remains the only cast member of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</strong></a> to have stuck with the show since day one.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=399 data-current-count=399 data-injectable=false>With yet another season on the horizon, one can’t help but wonder what Kyle did before the show. We know she has a proclivity for fashion; when she’s not doling out thousands of dollars on a shopping spree with her girlfriends, she’s creating boutique stores and fashion lines. Did she always work in fashion? Did people even know her name before the show? Here’s what you should know.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-before-real-housewives-kyle-was-a-child-actress data-injectable=false>Before Real Housewives, Kyle was a child actress</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=699 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=409 data-current-count=409 data-injectable=true>Believe it or not, Kyle’s claim to fame was starring in one of the most iconic, famous, lovable TV shows of all time Little House on the Prairie. She played Alicia Sanderson Edwards and appeared in nearly two dozen episodes across seven years. As a matter of fact, this writer’s father was one of the show’s screenwriters and has more than a few stories about seeing young Kyle doing her thing on set.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=336 data-current-count=336 data-injectable=false>Kyle was six years old when she started Little House on the Prairie, but astonishingly, that was neither her first nor last acting role. The 1974 TV series Police Woman was her first. Between 1974 and 1990, she scored a total of 28 acting credits, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">IMDb</a>, including the most recognizable role in her filmography: Halloween.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=448 data-current-count=784 data-injectable=true>Kyle played Lindsey Wallace in the first Halloween movie, the young girl many will remember as the child Jamie Lee Curtis’ Laurie Strode was forced to babysit after Annie Brackett (Nancy Loomis) decides she wants to go to a Halloween party with her boyfriend Paul, leaving them to face Michael Myers all alone. Kyle reprised the role 43 years later as the grown-up version of Lindsay in 2021’s Halloween Kills and 2022’s Halloween Ends.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>@KyleRichards</a> Look who I see on an old episode of ER from season 4! <a href=#>@Bravotv</a> <a href=#>@Andy</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/aU4J7Noe2H</a></p>— Arielle K. (@NYCMermaid1121) <a href=#>March 15, 2015</a></figure><p data-characters=305 data-current-count=605 data-injectable=true>Still, Halloween isn’t all that Kyle’s done. After 1990, she took a bit of an acting hiatus but then returned in 1999 to appear in TV series such as Beverly Hills, 90210, 7th Heaven, and even ER. She was on the soap opera Days of Our Lives in 2013 and even appeared in How I Met Your Father in 2023.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-no-she-wasn-t-always-married-to-mauricio data-injectable=false>No, she wasn’t always married to Mauricio&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Kyle-Richards-and-Mauricio-Umansky.jpg><p data-characters=443 data-current-count=743 data-injectable=true>Because we’ve only ever known her as the wife to real estate mogul <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mauricio Umansky</a>, it’s tricky to imagine Kyle as anything else other than that; she is, after all, known as a “Real Housewife.” In reality, Kyle was previously married to her first boyfriend Guraish Aldjufrie, with whom she had her daughter Farrah Brittany Aldjufrie at the age of 18. The marriage only lasted four years, and in 1990, the couple eventually divorced.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=288 data-current-count=288 data-injectable=false>Kyle and Mauricio met in 1994 and married in January 1996. The pair were married for 27 years when, in 2023, it was announced that they had “separated,” according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a>.&nbsp;Kyle denied accusations of a divorce in an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram post</a>, although did allude to a “rough year.”</p><h2 id=h-being-paris-hilton-s-aunt-was-her-in-to-pop-culture data-injectable=false>Being Paris Hilton’s aunt was her “in” to pop culture</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=588 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Kyle Richards Umansky (@kylerichards18)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=407 data-current-count=407 data-injectable=true>Oh, you didn’t know Kyle Richards was Paris Hilton’s aunt? Well, there you go. Paris’ mom, Kathy Hilton, is Kyle’s older sister. Before she was on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, Kyle was often spotted in specials about her niece (Paris was, after all, the most talked about celebrity of the town back then) and even made frequent visits to her reality TV series Paris Hilton’s My New BFF.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=162 data-current-count=162 data-injectable=false>Thanks to Real Housewives, Kyle continues to be a presence in pop culture, but let it be known that she had a mighty leg up thanks to her uber-famous niece.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-she-can-t-be-a-housewife-forever data-injectable=false>She can’t be a Housewife forever</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Kyle-Richards-.jpg><p data-characters=462 data-current-count=462 data-injectable=true>Over a decade is a long time for anyone to stay with a TV show, let alone a reality TV show filled with as much drama as The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. When Kyle made her debut, she was only 41 years old. Several seasons and cosmetic procedures later, she’s now in her mid-50s and undoubtedly nearing the end of her time on the show. Then again, if Kandi Burruss from The Real Housewives of Atlanta can manage to stay afloat for 15 seasons, so can Kyle.</p><p data-characters=289 data-current-count=289 data-injectable=false>When the fateful day that Kyle does eventually leave the franchise arrives, we can likely expect her to continue making appearances as a friend of the cast. However, with more time on her hands, she’ll surely keep her acting chops sharp with further appearances in movies and TV shows.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=414 data-current-count=703 data-injectable=false>Let’s not forget she also has her clothing line Kyle x Shahida, which is still going strong as of this writing.&nbsp;She may have been only an actor before The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, but now she’s that, a business owner, an entrepreneur, a socialite, and a television personality. Reality show or not, she’ll always take a page out of Rihanna’s book and shine bright like a diamond.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZpuinF2gxq2xjKugnKCRp7G0ecOoZJudlqS%2FpnnRnpilZZikwrSx1qKtnqtdpLNursSvnKukqWK1qrjLrGY%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-did-kyle-richards-do-before-real-housewives-of-beverly-hills.html&text=What%20did%20Kyle%20Richards%20do%20before%20Real%20Housewives%20of%20Beverly%20Hills%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-did-kyle-richards-do-before-real-housewives-of-beverly-hills.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-did-kyle-richards-do-before-real-housewives-of-beverly-hills.html&title=What%20did%20Kyle%20Richards%20do%20before%20Real%20Housewives%20of%20Beverly%20Hills%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-did-kyle-richards-do-before-real-housewives-of-beverly-hills.html&title=What%20did%20Kyle%20Richards%20do%20before%20Real%20Housewives%20of%20Beverly%20Hills%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-did-kyle-richards-do-before-real-housewives-of-beverly-hills.html&title=What%20did%20Kyle%20Richards%20do%20before%20Real%20Housewives%20of%20Beverly%20Hills%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-did-kyle-richards-do-before-real-housewives-of-beverly-hills.html&description=What%20did%20Kyle%20Richards%20do%20before%20Real%20Housewives%20of%20Beverly%20Hills%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./titans-season-3-who-is-red-hood-how-will-he-be-different.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Red Hood and How Will His Origin Be Different?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./morris-county-man-killed-in-ny-snowmobile-crash-police.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Morris County Man Killed In NY Snowmobile Crash: Police">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
