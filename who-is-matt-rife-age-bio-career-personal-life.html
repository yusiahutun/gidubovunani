He later moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in the entertainment industry. The actor and comedian was born to Michael Eric Gutzke and April Rife. The actor’s biological father, Michael, killed him when he was just 17 months old. The actor has four siblings: three older stepsisters and one younger half-sister.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Matt_Rifes_Career></span><b>Matt Rife’s Career</b><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>The comedian’s career began while he was a teenager. At the age of 14, he expressed interest in comedy after learning that his high school will be hosting a talent show from a teacher. At the age of 15, he began giving professional performances. His approach was influenced by the actors he grew up watching, including David Spade, Jim Varney, Adam Sandler, Robin Williams, and Jim Carrey.</span></p><p><span>Since he was fifteen years old, this budding star has been giving professional performances. In addition to being the creator and host of MTV’s well-known programme “Wild N Out,” Matt has been in “Average Joe” and “WTH: Welcome to Howler.” His performance in “Average Joe” won him praise from critics. At the age of 17, he made history on “ComicView” as the youngest performer ever. Additionally, he had an appearance in a “Acting Out” comedy show episode.</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Matt-Rife-1.webp alt="Who Is Matt Rife?

He appeared in 10 “Wild & on Tour” episodes in 2016. In the same year as Cameron Boyce, Murray Wyatt Rundus, Felix Avitia, and Sophie Reynolds, he was cast as Jesse in the comedy series WTH: Welcome to Howler. He participated in Bring the Funny in 2019 and made it to the Semi-Final Showcase. By the sixth week, he was out.</span></p><p><span>His humour is available to fans on a number of internet channels. He is active on many social media sites, with millions of followers on TikTok, among them. In addition, he uploads comedic videos to his 1.81 million+ follower YouTube channel.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The comedian travels the world performing in shows and tours. Fans can buy tickets and get updates about his tours on his dedicated website. He offers his branded products in a shop on his website.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In addition to sharing the stage with well-known comedians like Erik Gryphon, Deray Davis, Mike Epps, Finesse Mitchell, Dane Cook, and Ralphie May, he has also gone on international tours. In addition to becoming a well-known figure in the comedy world, he is the Laugh Factory’s youngest regular male performer.</span></p><p><span>Acting is his second interest after comedy, and his growing popularity as a comic has helped him seize opportunities in that field as well. He performed in a few Disney productions before landing his big break as a star of MTV’s hit series “Wild N Out” in season seven. In addition, he was the show’s youngest cast member. He also appeared in the BET series “ComicView.” He was, once more, the youngest contestant to appear on the show.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Matt_Rife_Married></span><b>Is Matt Rife Married?</b><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>No, Matt Rife is not yet married.
