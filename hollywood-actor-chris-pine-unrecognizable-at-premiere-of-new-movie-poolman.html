The <a href=#>celebrity</a>‘s rocking an untamed beard, long hair, tight shorts, boots, and a laid-back tee. A far cry from the attire you’d expect at a film premiere, by any stretch of the imagination.</p><p>“What in the [] hell is Chris Pine going through?” one joked on X/<a href=#>Twitter</a> upon checking out his latest look. Another reacted: “Why does Chris Pine refuse to be hot?” Others, however, have praised the bold look and said it’s bringing Jeff Bridges vibes. The dude abides.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-chris-pine-says-him-and-poolman-character-are-50-50>Chris Pine says him and Poolman character are ’50/50′</h2><p>If you’ve seen the trailer, it’s clear that Chris is dressing as his character during the Poolman premiere, and he even arrived in Darren’s van emblazoned with the Awesome Aquatics logo.</p><p>“Where does Poolman Darren end and Chris Pine begin?” the actor and director was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">asked</a> by Entertainment Tonight on the evening. “We’ve been seeing you… with the long hair, the beard, the short-shorts, is that your everyday vibe?”</p><p>Chris answered that it’s “50/50. I would say the character I came up with… is a lot [of] me, for sure. So these are my shorts, this is my shirt.”</p><p>When the interviewer commented that “they influence each other in some way,” Chris agreed: “There you go. Art/life, life/art, sure.”</p><p>Scheduled to hit theaters on Friday, May 10th 2024, Poolman has already received negative reviews from critics despite having a stacked cast that includes Chris, Danny DeVito, Annette Bening, and Jennifer Jason Leigh. It currently has a very low 23% critic score on Rotten Tomatoes.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlsX2eCcLTOpaOyr5%2BksW6twq2mq2WTnb%2Bqv4ypoKedXaq7s7HCqJ6noaqWr62xjJqrZqiimrqqsdGeZKieXaOyuHnMqK2inV2lvLC4zJqlaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fiba-3x3-basketball-hong-kong-women-savour-facing-top-sides-olympic-qualifiers.html><span>←</span><span>Fiba 3x3 basketball: Hong Kong women savour facing top sides in Olympic qualifiers</span></a>
