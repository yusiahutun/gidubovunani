<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Casey Coates: What Happened to Ted Danson's Ex-Wife</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Casey Coates is an American environmental designer and an environmentalist. However, she is famous as the ex-wife of American actor, producer, and TV personality Ted Danson. Danson is renowned for his roles in numerous movies and TV series, including Neil Bremer in “Mr. Mayor” and Dr. Ray Petit in “American Dad!.”</p><p>Consequently, Coates’ ex-husband has received numerous accolades, including two Primetime Emmy Awards. The former couple was in a marital relationship for a long time before calling it quits. During Coates’ marriage to Danson, she suffered paralysis after giving birth to their first daughter.</p><p>Following their divorce, the former celebrity spouse dedicated most of her time to teaching about environmental conservation. Hence, she rarely appears in the media. Here’s everything we know about the renowned actor’s ex-wife.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/photo_2023-10-30_08-39-08-fotor-2023103084858.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Ted_Dansons_Ex-Wife></span>Who Is Ted Danson’s Ex-Wife?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Casey Coates was born Cassandra Coates in Long Island, New York, in 1938. Due to her cagey lifestyle, details about her exact date of birth elude the media. Although information on the identity of her parents remains a mystery, reports suggest her mother was an artist and her father was a musician.</p><p>Consequently, Coates was always an artistic kid as she redesigned her bedroom and painted raw wood. Growing up, Ted Danson’s ex-wife attended Great Neck High School. After graduating high school, she proceeded to join Lasell College in Boston.</p><p>Although Coates moved to London, she returned to New York after a year. She enrolled at Parsons School of Design, where she pursued a Bachelor of Fine Arts in environmental design. As a result, she graduated in 1975 with a distinction.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Does_Casey_Coates_Do></span>What Does Casey Coates Do?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After graduating from Parsons School of Design, Casey Coates started her career. The renowned actor’s ex-wife began by joining the Ben Thomson Firm in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Afterward, she served as a board member at Parsons School of Design, Southern California Institute of Architecture, and the Environmental Media Association.</p><p>In addition, the environmental activist served as a consultant for Jimmy Carter’s Work project in Los Angeles. Due to her passion for the environment, Coates co-founded “American Oceans” with Danson. However, she merged it with “Oceana” in 1987. More so, Coates started her initiative, Global Possibilities, a non-profit organization that focuses on educating on renewable energy sources in 1996.</p><p>In addition, she produced a one-hour documentary film, “Who’s Got The Power,” which focuses on the effects of global warming and the benefits of renewable energy. Coates also worked briefly as an administrative assistant at Wall Street.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/photo_2023-10-30_08-41-25-fotor-2023103085155.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Happened_to_Ted_Dansons_Ex-Wife></span>What Happened to Ted Danson’s Ex-Wife?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Casey Coates suffered a devastating stroke during childbirth due to undiagnosed high blood pressure. Consequently, Danson had to put his acting career on hold to take care of his wife and the newborn baby. However, Coates’ stroke created a gap in their relationship, and they struggled with it for a while. Although Coates could walk eventually, their marriage did not remain the same.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=When_Did_Casey_Coates_and_Acted_Danson_Meet></span>When Did Casey Coates and Acted Danson Meet?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ted Danson and Casey Coates met in 1976. In an interview, Danson revealed that it was love at first sight for him. The renowned actor added that although he was adamant that having more than one relationship is a far-fetched thing, it all changed when he met Coates.</p><p>Consequently, the former couple started dating sometime after Danson divorced his first wife, Randy Danson, in 1975. Back then, the now-famous actor wasn’t as famous as he is today. He only had several minor or guest roles in numerous TV series.</p><p>On the other hand, Coates was a renowned environmentalist. Fortunately, everything worked out, and the former couple tied the knot. Coates and her former husband exchanged vows in 1977 in an intimate wedding ceremony.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Led_to_Ted_Danson_and_His_Ex-Wifes_Divorce></span>What Led to Ted Danson and His Ex-Wife’s Divorce?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Casey Coates and Ted Danson’s marriage lasted sixteen years before the couple parted ways. According to reports, their relationship worsened in the late ’80s and early ’90s due to Coates’ health. However, his affair with actress Whoopi Goldberg contributed to their divorce, leading to one of Hollywood’s costliest divorces in 1993. According to reports, the divorce cost Danson $30 million.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Many_Children_Does_Casey_Coates_Have></span>How Many Children Does Casey Coates Have?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Casey Coates has two children from her marriage to Ted Danson. Two years after their wedding, Danson and Coates welcomed their first daughter, <a href=#>Kate Danson</a>, on December 24, 1979. Like her dad, Kate is also an actress. She has appeared in several movies, including “Cousins”.</p><p>Afterward, the former couple adopted a daughter, Alexis Danson, born in 1985. However, unlike her older sister, Alexis lives away from the limelight. Although they separated when their kids were still young, Coates and Danson never let them feel estranged. Consequently, the former couple maintained an amicable co-parenting relationship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/photo_2023-10-30_08-39-19-fotor-2023103084822.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Did_Casey_Coates_Remarry_After_Her_Divorce_From_Ted_Danson></span>Did Casey Coates Remarry After Her Divorce From Ted Danson?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>No, she did not. Following her divorce from Danson, Casey Coates remained single. However, her ex-husband, Danson, married his third wife, Mary Steenburgen, in 1995. <a href=#>Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen</a> do not share any biological children. However, the renowned actor is the stepfather to Steenburgen’s children, Charlie McDowell and Lilly McDowell.</p><p>Like Casey Coates, another former celebrity spouse who rose to fame thanks to their husband is actor Ron Perlman’s ex-wife, <a href=#>Opal Stone Perlman</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51ksKK%2FxLJknKeRqbK0edahmK1lmJa9sbHNnptmrJ9iwaawjJ2Yp6ufo8BusddmrqKelWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./476373-what-happened-sam-shelton-case-ashley-reeves-condition-today.html><span>←</span><span>What happened to Sam Shelton?
