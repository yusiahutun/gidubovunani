However, this is not Joe Francis sole source of income. At the moment, Joe Francis&nbsp;net worth&nbsp;is said to have reached $25 million.</p><p>So how did Joe Francis reach this level? Let’s take a closer look at the life and times of Francis, so we can nail down his net worth and get a sense for how we got here.</p><h2>Joe Francis Early Life</h2><p>Francis was born on April 1, 1973, to Raymond Francis and Maria Francis. Francis was raised in America, but his family is of Austrian descent, as Maria immigrated to the United States from her home country before giving birth to Joe. He grew up in Newport Beach, California, after moving there with his family at the age of 7.</p><p>He is said to have attended a number of different boarding schools over the course of his childhood. Before attending these institutions, he was a student at Our Lady Queen of Angels Elementary School. After that, he moved to Laguna Beach, where he attended Laguna Beach High School. Once he completed high school, he&nbsp;attended&nbsp;the University of Southern California. While attending USC, Francis studied film and television. In 1995, he graduated with a Bachelor’s Degree.</p><h2>Joe Francis Career Path</h2><p>As soon as Francis graduated, he wasted no time putting his newfound skills to use. In fact, he got his start working as a production assistant for Real TV. This is the experience that he needed to start coming up with his own ideas. While working with Real TV, he developed the concept that would eventually become Banned From Television.</p><p>Real TV had a sizable amount of footage that could not be used and Francis had a brilliant idea. He decided to license this footage and use it for his own show. From there, he created a series of videos under the Banned From Television banner that depicted a wide range of events. At first, he enjoyed sharing shocking scenes with the public but after a while, he decided that it was time to move on.</p><h2>Joe Francis and Girls Gone Wild</h2><p>For many, this is when Francis became far more well-known within the public consciousness. Girls Gone Wild was created in 1997 and was a watershed moment for those who grew up during this moment in time. The concept was a simple one: he showed the audience college girls having the time of their lives and of course, the response was immediate.</p><p>The videos were a massive success, and it was not long before Francis began to amass a serious fortune. Within a few years, the videos are said to have made him at least $20 million. There was no avoiding them, either. Francis wisely chose to use infomercials as a means of advertising the videos, which allowed him to sell to a much wider audience.</p><p>This gave the company the chance to amass hundreds of millions in total over the lifespan of the video releases. Eventually, filming concluded because he was no longer allowed to do so within the state of Florida, giving Francis the chance to train his focus elsewhere.</p><h2>Joe Francis Real Estate</h2><p>After he stopped producing videos for the Girls Gone Wild company, Francis continued to fund his lifestyle through real estate. He is now the proud owner of a ritzy Mexican estate known as Casa Aramara. The 40,000-square-foot property is frequented by a number of wealthy celebrities and while it is&nbsp;worth&nbsp;$10 to 15 million, visitors are able to stay there for up to $35,000 per night.</p><p>Kim Kardashian, Eva Longoria, Demi Moore, Jennifer Aniston and Ashton Kutcher are all among the celebrities that have spent a night on Joe’s&nbsp;property. Even Mario Lopez decided to have his wedding there back in 2012. During better times, Kanye West and Kim Kardashian had their honeymoon at Casa Aramara in 2014.</p><p>This is not the only property that Francis owns, as he also purchased a massive estate in Bel-Air. The estate was constructed in 1995 and Francis made the purchase for $5.45 million in 2002. The highly sought-after home has 6,446 square feet of living space and is considered to be a prime location because of all the other celebrities who reside in the same neighborhood.</p><h2>Joe Francis Personal Life</h2><p>Francis has never officially married but in 2010, he entered into what is known as a “civil domestic partnership”. He and Christina McLarty made the union official in a ceremony at the Mexico estate. The ceremony went off without a hitch but the couple was eventually separated. In 2012, he began a new relationship with Abbey Wilson.</p><p>Wilson is widely considered to be one of the most beautiful women in the world, as she was one of the hottest emerging models in the United States at the time. She and Francis enjoyed a whirlwind courtship. Wilson even won the Hottest Girl in America&nbsp;contest, in case there was any doubt whatsoever. The couple never married but they did have two children (twin daughters).</p><h2>Where Does Joe Francis Go From Here?</h2><p>Of course, with such an illustrious past as a television producer, it is only natural for people to wonder where Joe Francis will go from here. While it is tough to predict, since Francis has amassed a large enough net worth to never have to work again, there are some tea leaves that can be read here.</p><p>For starters, Francis has always maintained a keen interest in real estate and it is easy to see him making future investments in this realm. Francis is also keeping his options open by maintaining some powerful celebrity alliances as well. Kim Kardashian remains in his corner and when you have connections like these, anything remains possible.</p><p>There is also a universe where Francis simply continues to reside in Mexico and use the property to rake in rental income. At the moment, he has a number of different options that he can take and is fortunate enough to not have to make any hasty decisions about his future.</p><p>If we had to guess, we have not heard the last of Francis and we look forward to seeing what else he has in store. Whether he is partnering with one of his celebrity friends or making more sound investments, he is fully expected to make his presence felt during the months and years to come.</p><h3>You can also read:</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiln6OyurXNnGWcp51kt7CxjJ%2BpmqaTnsBuusStZLCnoqm1cHiLZWNlZFw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cuticle-tattoo-ideas-7480304.html><span>←</span><span>9 Tiny Cuticle Tattoo Ideas We're Copying From Celebs</span></a>
