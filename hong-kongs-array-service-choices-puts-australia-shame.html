I was forced to drive my shuddering Volkswagen Polo, which had a fractured engine undercarriage, to work at a hospital for a month and a half before being able to secure an appointment for repairs. The state automobile club designates only three repairers in the area for the kind of work I needed. This trio feasts on the surfeit of car misfortune directed their way.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Weeks of repair delays later, I noticed my car’s engine mount still hanging by a thread. My request for a test drive was strenuously denied. No competition and no choice in services required for daily living breeds suppliers’ contempt and predatory behaviour.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Cheer up, Hongkongers.

Their parents must have taught them well.</p>Few pedestrians respond when I greet them in the streets in the morning. Few passengers are willing to give up their seats to the aged or those with disabilities on a crowded bus. Few hold the door for the next person when they enter or exit a building or the lift. Few in the service industry such as shops or <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">cha chaan teng</span></a> serve with basic etiquette. Few treat visitors with extra care or attention. What has happened to our city?<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hongkongers are simply too busy. Most are heavily engaged in what they do. They can’t spare any attention for anything else. They are unhappy, too, due to a range of unsolvable problems.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Being polite is a necessity, not just for children, but youngsters and adults, too. It implies that one respects everyone around one. It also shows that one is aware of one’s surroundings and isn’t just focused on oneself. If we are more polite to each other, an air of harmony will prevail. Visitors will have a better impression of the city, too.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Few in Hong Kong are aware of the importance of politeness these days. For youngsters especially, it isn’t even seen as an issue.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Raising awareness of this issue requires concerted efforts. I suggest the authorities run a citywide campaign with promotional activities on the topic.
