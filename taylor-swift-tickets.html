There are still <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Taylor Swift tickets</a> to The Eras Tour, and the prices have gone way down since they went on sale in 2022.</p><p><a rel=noopener href=#>The Eras Tour</a> is Swift’s sixth headlining concert tour following the Fearless Tour in 2009 and 2010; the Speak Now World Tour in 2011 and 2012; The Red Tour in 2013 and 2014; The 1989 World Tour in 2015; and the Reputation Stadium Tour in 2018. Swift was set to perform on her sixth concert tour, Lover Fest, in 2020, however the tour was postponed and eventually cancelled in February 2021 due to the current health crisis. “I love coming on here to tell you good news, or to share a new project with you,” she wrote on her social media accounts. “It’s not my favorite thing in the world to have to tell you news I’m sad about. I’m so sorry, but I cannot reschedule the shows that we’ve postponed. Although refunds have been available since we first postponed the Lover Fest shows, many of you hung onto your tickets and I too hung onto the idea that we could reschedule,” she wrote on her social media at the time. “This is an unprecedented pandemic that has changed everyone’s plans and no one knows what the touring landscape is going to look like in the near future. I’m so disappointed that I won’t be able to see you in person as soon as I wanted to. I miss you terribly and can’t wait til we can all safely be at shows together again.”</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>Swift announced The Eras Tour in November 2022.
