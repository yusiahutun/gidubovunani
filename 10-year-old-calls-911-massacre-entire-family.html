Gary Knight <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>explained in a press conference</strong></a> on Tuesday.</p><p>When police responded to the scene, they found five people "beyond saving" inside the home and determined the boy's father, 42-year-old Jonathon Candy (pictured), 42, "became involved in an altercation" with his wife Lindsay, 39, before arming himself with a gun and shooting her "multiple times, killing her."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:6d2104fe-5e87-4342-a8c6-7e6acb18bb24 data-container-ref=toofab:article:857e6753-0b85-4d14-a77b-b98b1d115794 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/df/5by4/2024/04/23/dfd4cb07e4974a199fd749852179e657_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">NBC 6</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Man Kills Girlfriend, Shows Video of Body to Her Ex Before Driving to Police Station with Corpse: Cops</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"At that point, he systematically went through the home shooting and killing their children," said Knight, who said all three of the deceased kids belonged to the couple. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Per a press release</strong></a> from the Oklahoma City Police Department, the victims included Lindsay and sons Dylan, 18, Ethan, 14, and Lucas, 12.</p><p>"There was one child, the one who called 9-1-1, who was found unharmed. We don't know why he was left unharmed," Knight continued, saying that's a question nobody will ever likely know the answer to, as the boy's father took his own life after the killings.</p><p>"It's unclear what made him want to go through the home, killing the children. But make no mistake about it, what happened in that residence was nothing short of a massacre," said Knight, who added the children were "hunted down and killed."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:c8dde28c-1266-4d8f-b365-475f9e6c6f11 data-container-ref=toofab:article:857e6753-0b85-4d14-a77b-b98b1d115794 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/a3/5by4/2024/04/23/a358cf643f3b4b2ea1c28e53d9839fbe_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Prosecuting Attorney for Fayette County, West Virginia</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Man Claimed Son-In-Law Killed Daughter But The Truth Is More Twisted -- And 'Incestuous': Prosecutors</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Per Knight, the surviving child "apparently had been asleep" during his father's alleged rampage and "woke up and discovered what had happened." Knight told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>ABC News</strong></a> that the door to the boy's bedroom was closed at the time and he had a box fan running inside the room. "There is no indication he didn't sleep through it," he added.</p><p>Police confirmed two bodies -- those of Lindsay and one of the children -- were found downstairs, while the other two were upstairs. At least one of the children was shot in their bed. Knight added the couple had no history with police or any calls regarding domestic abuse.</p><p>"It was a horrible thing for everybody," said Knight, "it was certainly most horrible for the young man who woke up and found the carnage."</p><p>The boy is now with relatives.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:5d72782f-8bc6-475f-8dc7-af74ae56424d data-container-ref=toofab:article:857e6753-0b85-4d14-a77b-b98b1d115794 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/62/5by4/2022/10/25/62aeac998bbc41dc8c60b4db78b78ff9_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Lacey Police Department</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Husband Who Buried Wife Alive After She Made Terrifying 911 Call from Apple Watch Sentenced for 'Horrific' Crime</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>The Candy family, meanwhile, issued a statement to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>FOX News</strong></a>.</p><p>"Our entire family has been left shattered and confused with so many questions we won’t ever have answers to," the family said.
