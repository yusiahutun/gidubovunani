The plot of the movie revolves around a group of students from different cliques who are thrown together in Saturday school as punishment for separate offenses. In the end, they find common ground and dub themselves “a brain, and an athlete, and a basket case, a princess, and a criminal,” also known as “The Breakfast Club.”</p><p id=par-5_68>With a Fresh Rating of 89% and an impressive Audience Score of 92% on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, The Breakfast Club stands the test of time as one of the great comedies of the ‘80s.
