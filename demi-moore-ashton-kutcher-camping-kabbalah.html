Their Kabbalah instructor Yehuda Berg – pictured above&nbsp;with the couple and his wife Michal –&nbsp;is also reported to have joined them. The spiritual leader is the son of the founder of LA's Kabbalah centre and has written several international best-selling books on the religion, based on Jewish mysticism. He has been instrumental in Ashton and Demi's relationship. "I credit the success of my marriage to the teachings of Yehuda Berg," writes Ashton in way of review of Yehuda's book,</p><p id=e657K2xcRu0 data-wc=14>The Spiritual Rules of Engagement: How Kabbalah Can Help Your Soul Mate Find You.</p><p id=eiF0gxs6_E2 data-wc=29>"My wife helped a little too…And I was there." The actor goes on to say that Yehuda's wisdom "has led to a greater happiness than I ever thought possible".</p><p id=em5Vp9ZX8X data-wc=23>The description of the book states how dad-of-five Yehuda "regularly provides counsel to hundreds of individuals and couples, and is happily married himself".</p><p id=efxDqdc_BK data-wc=52>It also says that "it is the women who holds the power to determine the outcome (in relationships)." Some of the relationship advice offered by the teacher – who was often spotted with Guy Ritchie and Madonna (below) – would probably have followed the Kabbalah precepts, as outlined on the centre's website.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/151b2eb7f57d-yehuda-berg-guy-maddona-z.jpg><p id=eiwcfYR3nY-N data-wc=43>The faith views difficulties and disagreements as opportunities to grow. The website adds: "What seems to be a problem is actually a gift: a chance to remove an internal obstacle that stands between ourselves and the unlimited happiness that is our real destiny."&nbsp;</p><p id=elD83uYziZ data-wc=58>Two days before their camping trip the couple made a<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;show of solidarity</a> at a Kabbalah service marking the Jewish day of atonement. In line with custom, the pair sat on opposite ends of the aisle. But they greeted each other with a hug after the service and walked out with their arms wrapped around each other's waists.&nbsp;</p><p id=e8FUYONVqlm data-wc=67>And in a further show of support, Ashton has broken the Twitter silence that has existed between his and Demi's accounts in the past few months. "Good luck for tonight, you should be proud," he tweeted, ahead of the airing of Five, a group of films which Demi helped direct with other stars including Jennifer Aniston. The films explore the impact of breast cancer on people's lives.</p><p id=e9Q_l3YnzsFD data-wc=5><a class=hm-link href=#>More on Demi and Ashton</a></p><p id=e3a9sI4ZQy61 data-wc=4><a class=hm-link href=#>An age defying romance</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2hlah8c3yQamhpaWFrgHF8jp2cpqFdorywvsRmmKygpKS7brfUrZqhnaJisKK5z6KloGWblq%2Bjrcuan2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dakota-johnson-lingerie-bodysuit-blazer-gucci.html><span>←</span><span>Dakota Johnson Nails Lingerie Dressing in a Sheer Bodysuit and Boxy Blazer</span></a>
