But it's not the worst we've ever heard ... by far.
The name North on its own is actually kinda cute, if you forget about the Elijah Wood movie of the same name from 1994.
By celebrity standards, it's almost normal!

Of the name, Holly says "<span>Growing up, there was a girl in my school named Rainbow and I was so envious of that name." Aurora is clearly an homage to <strong>"Sleeping Beauty."</strong></span><span></span></p><p>7.) <strong>Poppy Honey</strong>, <strong>Daisy Boo</strong>, <strong>Blossom Rainbow</strong> and <strong>Buddy</strong></p><p>Celebrity chef <strong>Jamie Oliver</strong> and wife <strong>Jools Oliver</strong> gave all their kids some hippie names too. Holly Madison would be proud!</p><p>6.) <strong>Denim Cole</strong> and<strong> Diezel Ky</strong></p><p><strong>Toni Braxton</strong> and <strong>Keri Lewis</strong> definitely had some unique names in mind for their two sons. "It was supposed to be spelled D-e-n-h-a-m," Toni says of Denim -- adding that she changed it after a nurse kept mispronouncing it. Her other son is named after German engineer <strong>Rudolf Diesel</strong>.</p><p>5.) <strong>Moxie CrimeFighter</strong></p><p>Magician <strong>Penn Jillette</strong> loves his daughter's wild name. "I love the name Moxie, I love that it's a purely American word, and those are rare, and I love that it stands for old fashioned spunk and energy. [His wife] EZ pushed for her middle name, 'CrimeFighter' because EZ doesn't have a middle name and thinks middle names are stupid. So, it's just a joke."</p><p>4.) <strong>Pilot Inspektor</strong></p><p><strong>Jason Lee</strong> and wife <strong>Beth Riesgraf</strong> got the name Pilot from a <strong>Grandaddy</strong> song. "They just liked the name Pilot, and I believe Inspektor came from a friend, Danny Masterson's younger brother," a rep also said when he was born.</p><p>3.) <strong>Audio Science</strong></p><p><strong>"Knight's Tale"</strong> actress <strong>Shannyn Sossamon</strong> says she and <strong>Dallas Clayton</strong> chose the name because "We wanted a word not a name, so my boyfriend read through the dictionary three or four times."</p><p>2.) <strong>Harley Quinn</strong></p><p><strong>Kevin Smith</strong> LOVES comics, so he named his daughter after the villainous girlfriend of The Joker from Batman. It's still kinda cool though, right?</p><p>1.) <strong>Kal-El</strong></p><p>Nic Cage and Alice Kim took their superhero love even further -- giving their son Superman's Kryptonian name.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2JlfnR7j29ma2lfoLauecqaqZ2Zo522orqMpJinsZVixKa%2F02alqKqknXq4sdKtZJuZkq56r63Mnqpo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-does-it-mean-to-dream-about-organizing-a-yearbook-committee.html><span>←</span><span>What does it mean to dream about Organizing a yearbook committee</span></a>
