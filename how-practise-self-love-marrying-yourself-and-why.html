Sologamy has reportedly been around since the early 1990s when an American woman, Linda Barker, married herself in front of seven bridesmaids and 75 guests. But to some, the “Godmother” of sologamy is the fictional character, Carrie Bradshaw.

But to some, the “Godmother” of sologamy is the fictional character, Carrie Bradshaw.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In a 2002 episode of the TV show, Sex and the City, she mused about marrying herself after lamenting that there are no special occasions that celebrate single people, aside from birthdays. Since the show aired, countless women, especially in the US, UK, Australia and Japan, have taken the solo plunge for real.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Do you want an open relationship like Will and Jada Pinkett Smith’s?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 2017, Erika Anderson married herself in New York to celebrate her independence and right to be single and happy.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I would describe it as women saying yes to themselves,” she said. “It means that we are enough, even if we are not partnered with someone else.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Like Anderson, Nneka Carter made a similar statement by marrying herself in Tampa, Florida, in front of 40 friends and family members. Her decision was prompted by her experiences during the pandemic.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The pandemic reminded me that I just need me to be happy,” she said. “I didn’t want to feel alone or lonely because I didn’t have a companion, or I wasn’t in a relationship.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/06/02/78096c30-ed1b-4cf0-bce3-a0d825473c18_d6b8207f.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Psychologist Ieva Kubiliute says that with more time spent at home alone, many individuals have opted for new methods to appreciate themselves and enhance self-compassion.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Conducting a sologamy ceremony can be the perfect way to enhance self-compassion and appreciate yourself in the best way possible,” she says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Some celebrities have also embraced self-partnering. Harry Potter actress Emma Watson, Victoria’s Secret model Adriana Lima, and Broadway singer Fantasia Barrino are among the stars who have publicly shared a commitment to themselves. All three subsequently started traditional relationships, but their declarations of independence are no less valid for that.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s symbolic,” Lima told her Instagram followers in response to questions about the ring on her finger. “I am committed to myself and my own happiness. I am married with me.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/06/02/4ef344f5-1d56-4eb3-a7c8-23f5324d0452_b479b6e2.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Self-marriage ceremonies come in many different forms, from traditional unions complete with customised vows, wedding dresses, flowers and cake, to any number of wild and wacky themed events with or without wedding guests.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Many self-weddings are do-it-yourself affairs. For example, one company in San Francisco, I Married Me, offers a self-wedding kit, which includes a wedding ring, vows and self-affirmation cards. But the wedding and hospitality industry has also begun to cater to the “Me, Myself and I” clientele.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In Mexico, the Rosewood Mayakoba’s Sense Spa in Riviera Maya has offered a four-day Marry Oneself Journey complete with your own private shaman consultation. In Japan, where the traditional marriage rate is declining, solo weddings are touted as a growing trend among women who crave the romance of a wedding but not the commitment of an actual marriage.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">If someone has achieved something so important as self-love and self-compassion, then it’s definitely worth celebrating. Why should couples have all the fun?Roberta Lyndall Fincham, who married herself at age 55</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Currently, several Japanese travel agencies and photo studios offer single wedding packages that may include a dress, hair and make-up, flowers, a limo, and a photo shoot. Most of their clients are young women looking to have some fun while asserting their independence, though some divorcees, along with married women whose big day was a let down, also sign up for the wedding of their dreams.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At first glance, marrying yourself might seem somewhat conceited. However, proponents claim it’s a feel-good gesture of self-belief rather than narcissism, as Roberta Lyndall Fincham, who married herself at the age of 55, explains.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I chose to do this in recognition of the culmination of my journey to loving and accepting myself, and recognition that I didn’t need to be in a romantic relationship with a significant other to be happy or find fulfilment,” she said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“If someone has achieved something so important as self-love and self-compassion, then it’s definitely worth celebrating.
