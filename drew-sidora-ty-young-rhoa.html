Drew and Ralph filed for divorce from Drew in March 2023 after nine years of marriage. Ralph listed their date of separation as February 19, 2023, while Drew listed it as February 23, 2023. “Love is a beautiful thing,” Ralph said in a statement to <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>People</a> at the time. “Unfortunately we have made the difficult decision to move on to our next chapters, independent of each other. Drew and I have decided to file for divorce. We have three amazing young children, and their mindset and growth is what is most important. As we navigate this difficult time, I ask that you please respect our privacy.”</p><p>Drew added in her own statement, “After eight years of wholeheartedly fighting for my marriage, I have made the agonizing decision to release my husband with love. Although Ralph and I have decided to move forward separately, the hope is to remain friends so that we can co-parent responsibly. In spite of our very public life, I am asking for privacy during this difficult time as my children and I learn how to navigate through our new beginnings.”</p><p>In the filing, Drew, who filed for divorce an hour before Ralph, accused Ralph of being a “serial cheater and adulterer” who abused her mentally, financially, and got “physically aggressive” with her. Drew doubled down on her filing in an interview with <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>People</a> in June 2023. “Well everything in the petition I obviously stand by and it was just a culmination of things that should not happen in a marriage,” Drew said. “And I think the inability to own it, the inability to apologize, the inability to work through it, the inability to care about my emotional state and wanting to work and heal that, was very challenging.”</p><p>Drew told People that her “boiling point” was when their marital issues “started to happen on camera” on The Real Housewives of Atlanta and she began to feel “embarrassment on top of what we were dealing with behind closed doors.” “[It was] definitely the breaking point and enough is enough,” she said. “And I didn’t see that coming. Of course I was forever, but it was like [there was] nothing else left for me to hold onto because the behavior and inappropriateness just never stopped. It was just too much.”</p><p>In a statement to People, Ralph denied that Drew’s filing told the true story of the reason for their divorce. “I love my wife with all my heart. It is no secret that marriage is a challenging journey, one that is not for the faint of heart,” she said. “My family means the world to me and I’ve dedicated myself to providing support, encouragement and acting as a pillar of strength for my wife and children.”</p><p>He continued, “Although we know the real reason that ultimately led to my request for divorce, I’m taking this time to be more introspective and working to become the best version of myself. I stand by my response to the petition however I sincerely apologize for my part in the deterioration of our relationship. As seasons change, I’m hopeful and optimistic for brighter days ahead.”</p><p>Drew, for her part, told People at the time that she was “hopeful for an amicable divorce.” “I’m hoping for a great co-parenting partner. I’m hoping for us to come out of this and be able to be friends and be respectful,” she said. “I’m hoping for my kids to be happy and just to really see what life has for me on the other side of all this. It’s hard to imagine right now, but I would love to just be completely whole moving forward.”</p><p>The Real Housewives of Atlanta is available to stream on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Peacock</a>.</p><p>Our mission at StyleCaster is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
