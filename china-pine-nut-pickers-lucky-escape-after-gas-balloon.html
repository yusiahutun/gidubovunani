The large white balloon attracted the attention of villagers on the ground, who alerted local police.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“They knew how to operate [the balloon] but they didn’t dare to land immediately because there were trees, so they floated for some time and landed on their own,” a police officer said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/09/24/358ec694-dddb-11e9-94c8-f27aa1da2f45_1320x770_111537.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">China’s aviation rules require users of hydrogen balloons bigger than 3.2 cubic metres to seek advance approval from meteorological authorities at prefecture level or above. But, while the men may face a penalty, they are lucky to have escaped with their lives.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Two years ago a 59-year-old pine cone picker named Bi Kesheng from Jian – another county in the Changbai mountains – went missing after his balloon rose unexpectedly and disappeared in foggy conditions before his colleague could grab it back. He was never seen again.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Pine nuts are a major source of local income for the villagers who live in the foothills of the mountains, the country’s largest production base for the nutritious seeds. China contributed about a third of the world’s average pine nut production in the past five years, at more than 8,800 metric tonnes each year according to the International Nut and Dried Fruit Council.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">China is also the world’s biggest exporter of shelled pine nuts, accounting for more than 60 per cent of global exports in the past five years, according to the council’s statistical yearbook for 2018/19.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/09/24/36055232-dddb-11e9-94c8-f27aa1da2f45_1320x770_111537.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The pine cones are usually harvested from trees either in the wild or grown in orchards between mid-September and mid-October. Traditionally, villagers have climbed to the top of the trees – which can be up to 30 metres tall – using spikes attached to their shoes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It is dangerous work, as climbers can fall and be seriously injured, or even killed, if they lose their footing or if branches break. Gas balloons were introduced in recent years to save labour but the new method has also turned out to be dangerous, with several similar accidents reported by local media in recent years.</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Balloon pair land in trouble with police</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miaoaGelny0u8KinK2xX5a%2FtbXCpZxoa2BnhnqFj2iaoaGelnqxtc2eZKetpGK9qq%2FKnqmsZZyqsKzFjJ6qnJmgmnqistOeqWafkah6o63Lpaaopg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brad-paisey-those-crazy-christians.html><span>←</span><span>Brad Paisley Explains His Other Controversial Song on Wheelhouse, Those Crazy Christians</span></a>
