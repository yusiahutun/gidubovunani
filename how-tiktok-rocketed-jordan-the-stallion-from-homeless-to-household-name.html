His older brother had started an account secretly, but after the algorithm catapulted one of his videos out of obscurity, Jordan thought there might just be something to this<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> trendy app</a>. So in May of 2020, he began posting his own content to the app as a joke, or so he told himself.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=787 data-current-count=787 data-injectable=true>As you are no doubt painfully aware, May 2020 was something of an “unprecedented time”; the COVID-19 pandemic had the world in its grip and the majority of us were posted up on our couches, with not much to do but play <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Animal Crossing</a> (which reminds me that I haven’t stepped foot on my island in literal years) in our pajamas. Jordan was no different, and the pandemic – combined with a lack of prospects after graduating from UC Riverside – meant he didn’t have any pressing responsibilities to keep him from making his own silly TikToks. Sooner than he may have expected, he would attract his own audience on the app to the tune of nearly 10 million followers, but we’ll get to that; let’s start where this story truly begins: baseball.</p><h2 id=h-from-sleeping-in-his-car-to-division-i-baseball data-injectable=false>From sleeping in his car to Division I Baseball</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by UNINTERRUPTED (@uninterrupted)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=453 data-current-count=753 data-injectable=true>As he likes to tell it, Jordan was a bit of a late bloomer when it came to his goals. He and his brother grew up in Southern California (Oceanside, near San Diego, if <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Famous Birthdays</a> is to be believed), with a protective father who wouldn’t allow the siblings to play sports. In an interview with the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">You Should Know</a> podcast, Jordan says that by the time he transferred high schools at the age of 16, he was interested in finally trying one out.</p><p data-characters=373 data-current-count=373 data-injectable=false>“I didn’t know which sport — I just wanted to play one.” On his way to his school’s football field, the baseball coach called out to Jordan to try baseball. It’s not an exaggeration to say this small action would end up changing the trajectory of his life, and set up a love for the sport that would eventually lead him to play college ball.</p><p data-characters=437 data-current-count=810 data-injectable=true>When he first started, he was admittedly not great, but from the moment he first held a bat, Jordan decided he wanted to take his love for the sport as far as possible. Throughout that journey, he faced a lot of criticism, saying, “I’ve had coaches, I’ve had people tell me, ‘you’re not good, you’re not gonna make it.'” Jordan soon adopted the mindset that helped him keep focused on his goal.</p><p>“Whatever you want to do, as long as you don’t give up, as long as you keep finding a way to inch forward and forward…Forget what everyone else is saying.”</p><p data-characters=383 data-current-count=565 data-injectable=true>High school graduation came and went and he was nowhere closer to his dreams of playing the sport professionally. With no job prospects, no acceptance letter, and no offers, the college hopeful took to sleeping in his car. He would alternate between sending emails to prospective coaches and spending his free time weightlifting at the gym, hoping to develop some power in his swing.</p><p data-characters=329 data-current-count=329 data-injectable=false>Things were rough; he would often find himself deciding whether to spend his remaining money on food, gas, or other necessities. In a collaboration with athlete empowerment company, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Uninterrupted</a>, Jordan shared that he often “went to practice smelly” because he had to choose between affording a meal or buying soap.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=629 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=437 data-current-count=437 data-injectable=true>After many unanswered emails, Jordan was thrown a lifeline when he was given the chance to walk on to UC Riverside. He says he used what was left of his savings to enroll at the university, all for one chance to try out for the school’s Division I team. Paying the school just enough to make it to the walk on, he aimed to give it his all on the field, knowing all too well that it was likely his only shot at playing college ball.</p><p data-characters=390 data-current-count=390 data-injectable=false>After his tryout, he was told he would be contacted in seven days if he made it on the team. The next week was excruciating; UC Riverside’s quarter system meant midterms arrived early and with baseball weighing on his mind, Jordan failed his exams. To make matters worse, no financial aid meant he was expected to pay an additional $4000 if he planned on staying through the quarter.</p><p data-characters=305 data-current-count=695 data-injectable=true>Fortunately, on the seventh day, he was offered a chance to play on the team for a 10 day trial run, and for the next 10 days, saying he “was living on the field.” Jordan meshed with the team and after a rough post-high school journey, he had finally achieved his dream of playing D1 baseball.</p><h2 id=h-tiktok-fame-comes-calling data-injectable=false>TikTok fame comes calling</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@jordan_the_stallion8 href=#>@jordan_the_stallion8</a><p><a title=stitch href=#>#stitch</a> with @Movie Maniacs <a title=fypシ href=#>#fypシ</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Jordan_The_Stallion8" href=#>♬ original sound – Jordan_The_Stallion8</a></figure><p data-characters=646 data-current-count=946 data-injectable=true>After working so hard to reach his dreams, Jordan felt like a star when he returned to his small hometown on break. The initial euphoria one experiences after achieving something that once felt out of reach was as wonderful as it was fleeting, and soon, fear that he couldn’t maintain it set in. “I began to correlate my baseball success to my own personal worth,” he admitted before saying he realized, “you gotta slow down…you gotta see yourself as a human being.” For a while, that fear kept him working himself to the bone so that he could find a way to prove his worth to himself. Then COVID-19 happened.</p><p>“By the time COVID hit, I was in talks of getting drafted — which I was so elated for that. When COVID hit, that jacked all that up and it left me back at square one. Baseball was done, season was done, I graduated with my bachelor’s degree. I had to learn to understand that I have worth in just being myself, you know what I’m saying? And then, I found TikTok.”</p><p data-characters=478 data-current-count=870 data-injectable=true>In a lot of ways, TikTok was a happy accident. Inspired by his older brother, Jordan began posting content as a joke before deciding he wanted to share more of his personality on the app. His first videos felt “performative” to the newbie creator; he would plan them out and didn’t feel confident posting content off the cuff. That all changed when his first video went viral. “Everyone just started gravitating to me being an idiot, because I am.”</p><p data-characters=375 data-current-count=375 data-injectable=false>After the first success, he realized he could embrace being himself and opted for unscripted videos, choosing to film almost immediately after thinking of an idea. Soon, his improvised stitched videos (for the uninitiated, basically responding to another user’s video) helped him land an audience of 9.8 million TikTok followers, with an additional 2 million on Instagram.</p><p data-characters=455 data-current-count=830 data-injectable=false>His penchant for comedy, articulating relatable thoughts, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">deep knowledge of fast food restaurants</a> (according to Jordan he was part of a “fast food secrets” club in college) has helped him succeed in a career he never dreamed of. Although his dream of playing professional baseball hasn’t panned out the way he planned, the TikTok star’s fascinating journey shows that sometimes living life off script can be just as rewarding.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmejpLCqrctmpJ6cmZZ8qbvWZquio6SkuG6%2BzpyinqyVmXqru9GdmKdlpJ2ybr%2FTmqOloZ%2Bjeqe%2BzqZkoaedmrmmv9Jmq6hlmKTCtLHHqKOdZZ6WuqZ7</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhow-tiktok-rocketed-jordan-the-stallion-from-homeless-to-household-name.html&text=How%20TikTok%20rocketed%20Jordan%20the%20Stallion%20from%20homeless%20to%20household%20name&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-tiktok-rocketed-jordan-the-stallion-from-homeless-to-household-name.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-tiktok-rocketed-jordan-the-stallion-from-homeless-to-household-name.html&title=How%20TikTok%20rocketed%20Jordan%20the%20Stallion%20from%20homeless%20to%20household%20name" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhow-tiktok-rocketed-jordan-the-stallion-from-homeless-to-household-name.html&title=How%20TikTok%20rocketed%20Jordan%20the%20Stallion%20from%20homeless%20to%20household%20name" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhow-tiktok-rocketed-jordan-the-stallion-from-homeless-to-household-name.html&title=How%20TikTok%20rocketed%20Jordan%20the%20Stallion%20from%20homeless%20to%20household%20name" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-tiktok-rocketed-jordan-the-stallion-from-homeless-to-household-name.html&description=How%20TikTok%20rocketed%20Jordan%20the%20Stallion%20from%20homeless%20to%20household%20name" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./how-to-paint-bathroom-taps-black.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How to transform your entire bathroom for 23 with an easy DIY hack">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./helen-hunt-plastic-surgery-and-face-transformation.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Helen Hunt Plastic Surgery and Face Transformation">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
