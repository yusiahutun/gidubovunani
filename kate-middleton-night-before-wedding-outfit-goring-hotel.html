Looking as composed as ever as she was photographed checking in, the brunette beauty looked the picture of calm and happiness outside the five-star Goring Hotel in London which is super near Buckingham Palace and of course, Westminster Abbey where the couple said ‘I do.’</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8815ce68480e-gettyimages-113262151.jpg><p id=ecjiC06Xpgh data-wc=71>Kate wore a truly beautiful, timeless outfit which absolutely wouldn't look out of place today. She opted for a monochrome look, consisting of a black dress with white detail, black high heel shoes with a cork wedge, and a stunning white blazer which had appliqué detail at the button edge. Stunning! You could rock this look in 2024, anyone could. It's ideal for a formal occasion and is a classic ensemble.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ea308626fad6-gettyimages-123627146.jpg><p id=e4TSKhS5eq_ data-wc=50>The now mother-of-three wore her famous hair loose and flowing, expertly coiffed and blowdried.

A TV was installed in the bathroom, so that Kate could lie in the bath and watch the wedding build-up on a flat screen.
