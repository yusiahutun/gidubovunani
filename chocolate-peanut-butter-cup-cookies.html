I thought I’d try my hand at them one day. But then in December, rumor has it that this cookie won the annual cookie contest at my publisher’s. And as a certain cookie — the gooey oat / bake sale winning-est bars in my second <a href=#>cookbook</a> — won the previous year, this cookie effectively knocked it off its pedestal, oh, my interest was piqued.

I theorized that we liked the idea of them more than the taste. I narrowed my eyes at every recipe being an exact replica of the Google result before it, not a quarter-teaspoon of salt differential between them. How could a recipe be so… unscrutinized? I make a recipe the first time and declare it perfect, above tweaking, about once a year. But I made them to the letter and, indeed, they are fantastic. My husband and <a href=#>kids</a> thought they’d won the lottery (I reminded them — ahem! — they already had.)</p><p><a title="chocolate peanut butter cup cookies" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm5.staticflickr.com/4741/25162681237_22dd8bfb3c_z.jpg alt="chocolate peanut butter cup cookies" width=640 height=427 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><a title="chocolate peanut butter cup cookies" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm5.staticflickr.com/4648/25162681047_7c7bb61cb2_z.jpg alt="chocolate peanut butter cup cookies" width=640 height=427 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>There was just one little thing. They were kind of pale. I feel with chocolate baked goods, one should go dark or go home. I don’t mean bittersweet; I mean intensity. I mean, I don’t believe a vanilla cake with two tablespoons of cocoa powder in it is a chocolate cake and never will. So, I increased the proportion of cocoa powder, and the cookies came out darker and more chocolaty, but not a whole lot. I considered going to a full half-half split between cocoa and flour, but suspected I’d run into structural issues if I pushed things that far, and instead used Dutch-process (a darker, more nutty variety that’s standard in Europe but sold here too) cocoa and you know how Mary Berry likes to say “why, you’ve really cracked it!” Well, she did not. But when I bit into the first cookie, well, it crossed my mind. They’re soft and brownie-like and basically just deathly good. I had three. Please come and remove the rest from my home.</p><p><a title="chocolate peanut butter cup cookies" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm5.staticflickr.com/4752/25162680957_6a470aa465_z.jpg alt="chocolate peanut butter cup cookies" width=640 height=426 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><h5>Previously</h5><p><b>One year ago:</b> <a href=#>An Easier Way To Make Cookies</a> and <a href=#>Guacamole</a><br><b>Two years ago:</b> <a href=#>Spaghetti Pie with Pecorino and Black Pepper</a> and <a href=#>Banana Pudding with Vanilla Bean Wafers</a><br><b>Three years ago:</b> <a href=#>Fried Egg Salad</a>, <a href=#>Caramelized Onion and Gruyere Biscuits</a> and <a href=#>Charred Cauliflower Quesadillas</a><br><b>Four years ago:</b> <a href=#>Homemade Dulce de Leche</a> and <a href=#>Cheese Blintz</a><br><b>Five years ago:</b> <a href=#>Intensely Chocolate Sables</a> and <a href=#>Pasta and White Beans with Garlic-Rosemary Oil</a><br><b>Six years ago:</b> <a href=#>Potato Chip Cookies</a> and <a href=#>Cheddar, Beer and Mustard Pull-Apart Bread</a><br><b>Seven years ago:</b> <a href=#>Roast Chicken with Dijon Sauce</a> and <a href=#>Mushroom and Farro Soup</a><br><b>Eight years ago:</b> <a href=#>Tomato Sauce with Butter and Onions</a>, <a href=#>Ricotta Muffins</a>, <a href=#>Mixed Citrus Salad with Feta and Mint</a> and <a href=#>Edna Mae’s Sour Cream Pancakes</a><br><b>Nine years ago:</b> <a href=#>Sugar Puffs</a>, <a href=#>Smashed Chickpea Salad</a> and <a href=#>Bittersweet Chocolate and Pear Cake</a><br><b>Ten years ago:</b> <a href=#>Key Lime Cheesecake</a>, <a href=#>Rigatoni with Eggplant Puree</a> and <a href=#>Candied Grapefruit Peels</a><br><b>Eleven years ago:</b> <a href=#>Icebox Cake</a></p><p><i>And for the other side of the world:</i><br><b>Six Months Ago:</b> <a href=#>German Chocolate Cake + A Wedding Cake</a><br><b>1.5 Years Ago:</b> <a href=#>Eggplant with Yogurt and Tomato Relish</a>, <a href=#>Blueberry Bread and Butter Pudding</a> and <a href=#>Summer Squash Pizza</a><br><b>2.5 Years Ago:</b> <a href=#>Takeout-Style Sesame Noodles with Cucumber</a><br><b>3.5 Years Ago:</b> <a href=#>Summer Squash Gratin with Salsa Verde</a>, <a href=#>Bourbon Slush Punch</a>, and <a href=#>Three-Ingredient Summertime Salsa</a><br><b>4.5 Years Ago:</b> <a href=#>Banana Nutella and Salted Pistachios Popsicles</a> and <a href=#>Charred Corn Crepes</a></p><h3 class="p-name jetpack-recipe-title fn" itemprop=name>Chocolate Peanut Butter Cup Cookies</h3><ul class=jetpack-recipe-meta><li class="jetpack-recipe-servings p-yield yield" itemprop=recipeYield><strong>Servings: </strong>22 to 24</li><li class=jetpack-recipe-time><strong>Time:</strong> <span class=time>30 minutes</span></li><li class=jetpack-recipe-print><a href=#>Print</a></li></ul>My changes to the standard recipe were as follows: First, I found it a little easier to assemble the cookies if I made the filling first, dolloped it out on a tray, and froze it while assembling the outer cookie layer. It doesn’t take any more time, and those more firm centers are easier to wrap the outer cookie around. I also added some sea salt to the filling. I found that the suggested amount of filling (3/4 cup each of peanut butter and sugar) consistently made way too much; I’ve reduced it slightly here (2/3 cup each) but you will likely still have a few blobs of extra filling; seems safer than too little. I found that a little more than the usual teaspoon suggested is ideal for the filling; I use a teaspoon measure and mound it a bit on top, so it’s more like 1 1/2 teaspoons. This gives you an almost equal striation of cookie-filling-cookie.<p>My bigger changes were to the chocolate cookie itself; I increased the amount of cocoa and decreased the amount of flour for a dark, more intensely chocolate cookie. I then used Dutch/Dutched cocoa instead (a nuttier, darker cocoa standard in Europe but sold here too under brands like Droste and Valrhona; I then used baking powder (which needs to be used in larger quantities) instead of baking soda because Dutched-style powder doesn’t react as well with baking soda as well. <b>If you don’t have Dutched cocoa</b> and want to use natural (i.e. any American brand such as Hershey’s or one labeled as natural), you can do so here and use the more standard 1/2 teaspoon baking soda instead of 2 teaspoons of baking powder; it simply makes a lighter-colored cookie.</p><ul><h5>Filling</h5><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>2/3 cup (170 grams) creamy peanut butter</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>2/3 cup (80 grams) powdered sugar</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>Two pinches of flaky seas salt</li><h5>Cookie</h5><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1/2 cup (115 grams or 4 ounces) unsalted butter, at room temperature for a mixer, cold is fine for food processor</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1/2 cup (100 grams) granulated sugar, plus more to coat cookies</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1/2 cup (95 grams) dark brown sugar</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1/4 cup (65 grams) creamy peanut butter</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1 large egg</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1 teaspoon (5 ml) vanilla extract</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1 1/3 cups (175 grams) all-purpose flour</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>2/3 cup (55 grams) dutched cocoa powder (see note)</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>2 teaspoons baking powder</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1/4 teaspoon fine sea or table salt</li></ul><strong>Heat oven:</strong> To 375 degrees F.<p><strong>Make filling:</strong> Line a small tray or plate with parchment paper. In a medium bowl, mix peanut butter, powdered sugar, and salt with a fork; it’s a little messy but it will come together. Once evenly mixed, use a teaspoon measure to scoop <i>heaped</i> teaspoons of filling into little balls. Spread them out on prepared tray or plate. Once you’ve used all the filling, put the tray in the freezer while you make the cookie portion.</p><p><strong>Make cookie with a hand or stand mixer:</strong> Beat softened butter with peanut butter and sugars until creamed together. Add vanilla, egg, and salt, and beat until combined. Sift in baking powder and cocoa, beat to combine, then add flour and mix until flour disappears.</p><p><strong>Make cookie in a food processor:</strong> Pulse flour, cocoa, baking powder, salt, and sugars in food processor until mixed. Cut cold butter (if using, softened works fine here too) into chunks and add to bowl. Run machine until fully blended. Add peanut butter, egg, and vanilla and run machine until it is blended, scraping sides down as needed, and then keep running until dough balls together.</p><p><strong>Assemble cookies:</strong> Place 1 to 2 tablespoons extra granulated sugar in a small bowl. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Take a scoop of cookie dough that’s just shy of 2 tablespoons (a #40 scoop holds 1.75 tablespoons and is perfect for this) and place it in the palm of your hand. Flatten it with your fingers. Take a peanut butter filling from the freezer and place it in the center, and wrap the chocolate dough around, rolling it in your palms until smooth. Roll it in the granulated sugar to coat, place it on your prepared baking sheet and gently flatten the cookie, just slightly, with your fingers. Repeat with remaining dough.</p><p><strong>Bake cookies:</strong> For 8 to 10 minutes. This is going to seem like really little time, and the cookies are definitely going to look underbaked, but remember that we are just baking a thin outer shell of a cookie (the center doesn’t need to be baked), and this does not take long. Let cookies rest and set up on baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to cooling rack to cool.</p><p><strong>Store:</strong> At room temperature in an airtight container.</p><h3 class=sd-title>Share this:</h3><ul><li class=share-twitter><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-twitter-34991 class="share-twitter sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Twitter"><span>Twitter</span></a></li><li class=share-facebook><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-facebook-34991 class="share-facebook sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Facebook"><span>Facebook</span></a></li><li class=share-email><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared class="share-email sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to email a link to a friend" data-email-share-error-title="Do you have email set up?" data-email-share-error-text="If you're having problems sharing via email, you might not have email set up for your browser.
