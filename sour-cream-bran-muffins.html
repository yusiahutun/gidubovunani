I ordered a pulled pork sandwiched stacked about as high as my chin, and in a frightening act of who-is-this-girl and what-did-you-do-with-Deb, finished all but one or two bites of it. Later, we (mercifully) spent some quality time at the gym, and at the exact moment that Alex said “Mmm… leftover applewood-smoked chicken for dinner!” I realized not only was I still full, I had the dreaded Meat Hangover.</p><p><span id=more-191></span></p><p><a href=# title="winter fruit salad"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/157/382945951_7b8fd01b62_z.jpg width=640 height=427 alt="winter fruit salad" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>We all detox differently. Some of us imbibe themselves with (I’m sorry, somewhat frightening) <a href=#>Master Cleanses</a> for weeks on end, others eschew breads, starches or noodles for as long as they can keep away, and a good lot of us chug water and chomp crudites till the bad feelings pass. But my Meat Hangover, like all of my other afflictions, came with very specific instructions: fruit salad, yogurt, and whole grains, and I was too glutted to argue.</p><p>Unfortunately, it’s just not fruit salad season, but deciding to throw my food mile-related guilt to the wind, I grabbed one of everything that looked edible. The grocery gods must have been smiling on me that day, because even blackberries were marked down to two dollars. I also had the great pleasure of buying <a href=#>Liberté yogurt</a> for the first time, and it just might be the best thing since <a href=#>Total</a>, so thank you to whomever whispered that brand name in my ear.</p><p><a href=# title="what you'll need"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/50131494232_7526e2b458_n.jpg width=320 height=213 alt="what you'll need" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a href=# title="add raisins, flour, bran"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/50130702278_2052362d1d_n.jpg width=320 height=213 alt="add raisins, flour, bran" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a href=# title="thick batter"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/50131493892_62e39459f4_n.jpg width=320 height=213 alt="thick batter" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a href=# title="ready to bake"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/50131268476_1131d45f21_n.jpg width=320 height=213 alt="ready to bake" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>When it came time to make bran muffins, however, I most embarrassingly became one of those reviewers on Epicurious that changes everything (“I replaced the cornmeal with Fritos and sugar with Splenda and cheese with skim milk, and I have to say, this recipe is terrible!”) yet expects similar results. Realizing I only had super-fancy butter left in the apartment, stuff I’ve been saving to make shortbread, I replaced the butter with oil. I exchanged yogurt for sour cream, because, it’s also what we had around, and swapped the raisins with dried cranberries because my husband, although he is wrong, has some strange issue with raisins I dare not to delve into the psychology of. Then, as if I had not maligned the recipe’s original intent enough, I added a quarter-teaspoon of cinnamon, to warm up the flavor.</p><p><a href=# title="baked sour cream bran muffins"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/50131493547_1b78b1a575_z.jpg width=640 height=427 alt="baked sour cream bran muffins" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Fortunately, this muffin is a winner, no matter how hard you try to wreck it. Lighter and fluffier than any bran muffin that has previously graced my palate, it’s moist but still structured and not the least bit cake-like (a muffin no-no, in my book). I baked them in brioche molds — to counter my ongoing guilt about buying the tins over six months ago and not yet once baking brioche — resulting in a pretty, ruffled treat. And just like that, my meatover dissipated. Just in time, really, as I’ve just heard about this <a href=#>Dinosaur BBQ</a> place, and must have my way with it soon.</p><p><span><strong>Note:</strong> These muffins got some fresh photos and in 2020 They originally looked like this:</span></p><p><a href=# title="bran-cran muffins"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/184/382945942_71f5442e6c_z.jpg width=640 height=427 alt="bran-cran muffins" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><h3 class="p-name jetpack-recipe-title fn" itemprop=name>Sour Cream Bran Muffins</h3><ul class=jetpack-recipe-meta><li class="jetpack-recipe-servings p-yield yield" itemprop=recipeYield><strong>Servings: </strong>12</li><li class=jetpack-recipe-time><strong>Time:</strong> <span class=time>40 minutes</span></li><li class=jetpack-recipe-source><strong>Source: </strong><a href=#>Gourmet, October 1991</a></li><li class=jetpack-recipe-print><a href=#>Print</a></li></ul>I updated this recipe in 2020 to make it a one-bowl recipe.<ul><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted, cooled slightly or 1/2 cup vegetable oil</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1/4 cup firmly packed light brown sugar</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1 large egg</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1 cup sour cream or yogurt</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1/4 cup molasses or treacle</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1 cup all-purpose flour</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1 teaspoon baking soda</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1 cup miller’s bran</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1/4 teaspoon cinnamon (optional)</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1/2 cup raisins, cranberries, or other chopped dried fruit</li></ul>In a large bowl, whisk butter and brown sugar until smooth. Add egg, sour cream, and molasses, whisk until combined. Sprinkle the baking soda, salt, and cinnamon (if using) over the batter and whisk until combined, and then 10 more times around the bowl — it cannot be too well-mixed at this point. Add flour, bran, and raisins; stir with a spatula until just combined. Divide batter between 12 well-buttered muffin cups and bake the muffins in the middle of a preheated 400°F. oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until they springy to the touch and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out batter-free. Turn the muffins out onto a rack and let them cool. [Note: For taller muffins, you could divide the batter between 9 or 10 muffin cups instead.]<h3 class=sd-title>Share this:</h3><ul><li class=share-twitter><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-twitter-191 class="share-twitter sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Twitter"><span>Twitter</span></a></li><li class=share-facebook><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-facebook-191 class="share-facebook sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Facebook"><span>Facebook</span></a></li><li class=share-email><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared class="share-email sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to email a link to a friend" data-email-share-error-title="Do you have email set up?" data-email-share-error-text="If you're having problems sharing via email, you might not have email set up for your browser.
