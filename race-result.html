Report</h2><p>Horse No 1 ROBOT MASTER (J107) B Thompson From a wide barrier was shifted across behind runners in the early stages.</p><p>Approaching the 400 Metres was briefly held up and when being shifted to the outside to obtain clear running made contact with SEIZING THE MOMENT.</p><p>Horse No 2 SIXTH GENERATION (G120) C Y Ho Jumped awkwardly.</p><p>When questioned regarding his riding in the early part of the Home Straight and as to whether there was an opportunity to improve between HAPPY DAILY and WAR OF COURAGE sooner than he did, C Y Ho stated that after following HAPPY DAILY and having WINNING TURN positioned to his outside, he commenced to shift out with a view to obtaining clear running to the outside of HAPPY DAILY.</p><p>He said when WINNING TURN did not continue to give ground as he had expected, he was then held up for clear running between the 400 Metres and the 300 Metres before shifting to the inside of HAPPY DAILY to secure clear running.</p><p>He added that when both HAPPY DAILY and WAR OF COURAGE shifted ground slightly, SIXTH GENERATION raced tight between those two runners between the 300 Metres and the 200 Metres.</p><p>C Y Ho further stated that his decision to shift out initially was influenced by the fact that he felt WAR OF COURAGE would shift out, resulting in the run which was already tight closing and he was of the opinion his best option at that stage was to endeavour to improve to the outside.</p><p>Sent for sampling post-race.</p><p>Horse No 3 SEIZING THE MOMENT (E444) B Avdulla Raced wide and without cover from the 900 Metres.</p><p>Approaching the 400 Metres was bumped by ROBOT MASTER which shifted out to obtain clear running, resulting in SEIZING THE MOMENT becoming unbalanced.</p><p>A veterinary inspection immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.</p><p>Horse No 4 SUGAR BALL (H394) M L Yeung From the outside barrier was shifted across behind runners in the early stages.</p><p>Over the final 100 Metres lay in and proved difficult to ride out to the finish.</p><p>Horse No 5 WAR OF COURAGE (C483) M Chadwick Over the final 100 Metres lay in and proved difficult to ride out to the finish.</p><p>Horse No 6 HAPPY DAILY (E294) Y L Chung Lay out on the Home Turn and as a result WAR OF COURAGE was able to improve to that runner's inside.</p><p>After the race, Apprentice Y L Chung reported that from a wide barrier he was instructed to take up a forward position.</p><p>Trainer C H Yip confirmed the instructions and stated that he issued such instructions on the basis that HAPPY DAILY had barrier trialed well on 9 April 2024 when it led and also he expected the pace of the event not to be quick in the early stages.</p><p>Horse No 8 SUPER UNICORN (H481) K C Leung Shortly after the start was bumped by SUNNY DA BEST which shifted in, resulting in SUPER UNICORN becoming unbalanced.</p><p>In the middle stages raced keenly and after the 1000 Metres got its head up when being steadied away from SIXTH GENERATION.</p><p>Approaching the 300 Metres was steadied and shifted to the outside of SIXTH GENERATION to obtain clear running.</p><p>Horse No 9 WINNING TURN (J163) H Bentley Lay out on the Home Turn and made contact with INVINCIBLE LUCKY.</p><p>Horse No 10 INVINCIBLE LUCKY (J119) Z Purton Jumped awkwardly.</p><p>Approaching the 400 Metres was bumped on the hindquarters by WINNING TURN which was having its first race start and lay out.</p><p>A veterinary inspection immediately following the race which included an endoscopic examination showed a substantial amount of mucus in the horse's trachea.</p><p>Sent for sampling post-race.</p><p>Horse No 12 SUNNY DA BEST (J118) K De Melo Shifted in at the start and was bumped.</p><p>After the race, K De Melo reported that his intention was to hold a forward position but not necessarily lead.</p><p>He said after his mount commenced well, it was able to assume the lead without being pressured to do so.</p><p>Sent for sampling post-race.</p><p>Horse No 13 VULCANUS (J150) L Hewitson Jumped only fairly.</p><p>Horse No 14 STRATHBARRY (H413) C L Chau After being placed in the barriers got its right hind leg momentarily on the starting gate partition.</p><p>Removed from the barriers, examined by the Veterinary Officer and passed suitable to start.</p><p>In the Home Straight lay in and near the 200 Metres was steadied when SUGAR BALL shifted out.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1mq5mTnruoe9Gamp5loprAtrjTaGlpamRlgXN8jms%3D</p></section><nav
