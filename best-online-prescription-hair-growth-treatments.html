Still, we have to recommend seeing a dermatologist to rule out any underlying conditions. Once you and your doctor figure out what could be causing your <a href=#>hair loss</a>, you can save some serious money by going the online route when it comes to at-home medications and treatments. Though, some of these companies have a doctor on staff to chat with, making it even easier.</p><p>There are three most common types of hair loss and it helps to determine which one you’re dealing with. There’s anagen effluvium caused by medications like chemotherapy; telogen effluvium, a temporary hair loss that usually happens months after a traumatic life event or stress (such as childbirth); and androgenetic alopecia or female pattern hair loss, the most common hair thinning on the top and on the sides of the head.</p><p>For the latter two conditions, the treatment is often the same, though, with telogen effluvium, hair loss is likely to clear up. But for those suffering from female pattern hair loss who see no end in sight, these options can be a life-saver.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/hers-hair-serum.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=hers-hair-regrowth-treatment>Hers Hair Regrowth Treatment</h2><p>If you want a more personalized approach, sign up for <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Hers</a> and chat with a doctor online about the right options for your hair loss.
