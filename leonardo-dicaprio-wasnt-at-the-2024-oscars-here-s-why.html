"This was a dark chapter of American history, and we spent many years to try to tell this story right. We are very thankful, not only to the Osage committee for embracing us and telling us their story, but for all the actors, Lily included, to help shape the entire narrative of this movie."</p><p>See more from the <a href=#><strong>2024 Academy Awards</strong></a> in the gallery below.</p><a id=gallery-link-ffa1a687-6792-42ba-a5df-45f424fc305a class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:ffa1a687-6792-42ba-a5df-45f424fc305a data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:458262cf-6a32-41ab-a2d8-a6af8266f30d data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/a5/4by3/2024/03/11/a590f18e6bb540a9864879594fda9dc1_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j2xmamlfobKwusCrm6hllJ6worzRoqZmr5Gou7V5wK1kraCVYn9xfpNmpqybkafAbrTEq5xmq12stbp7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./villalobos-owner-years-tia-torres-earning-from-her-profession-net-worth-she-she-has-achieved.html><span>←</span><span>Into The Life Of Tia Torres: Her Professional Endeavors, Earnings, and Net Worth</span></a>
