After initially getting his start with indie dramas such as <strong>George Washington</strong>, <strong>All the Real Girls</strong>, <strong>Snow Angels</strong>, and the thriller <strong>Undertow</strong>, Green broke out in a big way when he directed the blockbuster stoner comedy <strong>Pineapple Express </strong>starring <strong>Seth Rogen</strong> and <strong>James Franco</strong>. In addition, Green also directed the studio comedies <strong>Your Highness</strong> which starred Franco, <strong>Danny McBride</strong>, and <strong>Natalie Portman</strong>, and <strong>The Sitter</strong> starring <strong>Jonah Hill</strong> and <strong>Sam Rockwell</strong>. Green then returned to indie films with <strong>Prince Avalance</strong> starring <strong>Paul Rudd </strong>and <strong>Joe</strong> starring <strong>Nicolas Cage</strong>. He then went on to direct the <strong>Al Pacino</strong>-led drama <strong>Manglehorn</strong>, the <strong>Sandra Bullock</strong> political drama <strong>Our Brand is Crisis</strong>, and the <strong>Jake Gyllenhaal</strong> film <strong>Stronger</strong>, which was based on the life of <strong>Jeff Bauman</strong>, who lost his legs in the Boston Marathon bombings. Green then shifted genres once again and made the Halloween sequel trilogy for Universal and Blumhouse which consisted of <strong>Halloween</strong>, <strong>Halloween Kills</strong>, and <strong>Halloween Ends</strong>. Green has also worked on television directing episodes of <strong>Eastbound & Down</strong>, <strong>The Righteous Gemstones</strong>,<strong> Vice Principals</strong>, <strong>Mythic Quest</strong>, <strong>The Sex Lives of College Girls</strong>, <strong>Dickinson</strong>,<strong> Red Oaks</strong>, and <strong>There's Johnny</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Jason Blum</strong> of Blumhouse will produce the trilogy alongside <strong>James Robinson</strong> and <strong>David Robinson</strong> of Morgan Creek, which is the company that holds the rights to the Exorcist franchise. <strong>Danny McBride </strong>and <strong>Couper Samuelson</strong> of Blumhouse have also signed on to executive produce alongside Green, with the company’s project under the oversight of <strong>Ryan Turek</strong>.</p><p><strong>Scott Teems</strong>, who wrote/co-wrote the screenplays for horror films such as Halloween Kills,<strong> Firestarter</strong>, and the upcoming<strong> Insidious: The Red Door</strong>, developed the story for the film alongside McBride and Green.</p><p>Jason Blum told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Den of Geek</a> in June 2021.</p><p>“I love to do [these] kinds of movies because people are very emotional about it, I think it’s a high bar and it’s a challenge to do the movie. Remember, most of the audience coming to this — 95% of the audience who will, if we do our job right, come to see this movie — will not have seen the first Exorcist or even heard of it.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition to Green, the trilogy will be co-written by <strong>Peter Sattler</strong>, who worked with Green on an unaired adaptation of Freaks of the Heartland, a horror graphic novel. <a href=#>In an interview with Collider back in October 2021</a>, Green said:</p><p>“He's another film school buddy of mine and we just have got along great. We did this adaptation of this <strong>Steve Niles</strong> graphic novel a few years ago and just had a great time, it was so cool. So I brought him on board to jumpstart Exorcist with me. It's very cool.”</p><p>Chatting with Collider, Green also confirmed that the first film of the trilogy had been written and that the second two films were currently being outlined.</p><p>“So we've got a ways to go on that, but we know where we're going,” said Green. “It's a new journey [with] some familiar characters and some new ones as well.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Green also tells Collider’s Steve Weintraub that making the Exorcist films involves quite a change from the Halloween remake he just recently wrapped, despite both films being cult-classic horror franchises from the 1970s.</p><p>“They're just so unbelievably different. One is very primal and the other is very academic. So it's just trying to switch gears there. I'm sure I'll know more a year from now when I've gotten a handle on what Exorcist is. The script's written. And it was a very, entirely different writing process.”</p><p><strong>Michael Simmonds</strong>, who worked with Green on his Halloween trilogy, will be serving as the film's cinematographer.<strong> Amman Abbasi</strong> and <strong>David Wingo</strong> (who previously worked with Green on Our Brand Is Crisis, Joe, and Your Highness) composed the score.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Who isn't included in this new project? The late <strong>William Friedkin,</strong> director of the original film. When it was announced that a new Exorcist was in the works, Friedkin had this to say about it on Twitter:</p><h2 id=what-happened-in-the-original-39-exorcist-39-story>What Happened in the Original 'Exorcist' Story?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/the-exorcist-3-george-c-scott.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The story follows a little girl named Regan (<strong>Linda Blair</strong>), who is displaying new, incredibly disturbing behavior for a child her age, such as urinating on the floor in a room full of people and wielding a foul vocabulary that would make even the most hardened sailor blush. After many fruitless doctors’ tests — including the infamous arteriogram scene which made many movie-watchers physically sick — Regan's mother, actress Chris MacNeil (<strong>Ellen Burstyn</strong>), seeks the help of Jesuit priests at nearby Georgetown University. At this point, Regan is beyond the point of simply ruining her mother’s dinner parties, and Chris suspects that her daughter may even be responsible for the death of an old family friend.</p><p>Two priests, the wise Father Merrin (<strong>Max von Sydow</strong>) and the troubled Father Karras (<strong>Jason Miller</strong>), answer the spiritual call and visit the MacNeil home. It is there that they perform an exorcism on Regan, an act which Father Merrin refers to as "a dirty little secret the Catholic Church has kept hidden in the closet over the years." What unfolds on screen is some of the most gut-wrenching stuff in film history to that point — including a head-spinning, demon-quoting, and vomit-hurling Regan — which left audiences shaken, disturbed, and with some even seeking the aid of their local hospital or church groups. As such, the film was met with pushback from many communities that didn’t want The Exorcist shown in their theaters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Additionally, many industry insiders have criticized the film’s R-rating as opposed to the more appropriate X-rating, with the R-rating given at the time simply so that there would be a better return on the cash that had been dumped into the drawn-out production costs.</p><h2 id=what-about-the-other-39-exorcist-39-films>What About the Other 'Exorcist' Films?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The original Exorcist won an Oscar for the best-adapted screenplay, which is a difficult status for additional remakes and sequels to live up to—cursed production or not.</p><p><strong>The Exorcist II</strong> is widely seen as a failure, but <strong>The Exorcist III </strong>is viewed as a singular success in its own right. However, attempts at prequel stories such as <strong>Exorcist: The Beginning and </strong><strong>Dominion: Prequel to The Exorcist</strong> have largely failed to win over audiences. <a href=#>A television sequel</a> to <strong>The Exorcist</strong> was released in 2016 and starred <strong>Geena Davis</strong>, but only ran for two seasons.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The creator of the new Exorcist trilogy, David Gordon Green, implied in an interview with ScreenRant <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">that they may not ignore these additions to the original Exorcist</a>, as these other iterations of the story “can all fall into the acceptable mythology.”</p><h2 id=what-is-39-the-exorcist-believer-39-about>What Is 'The Exorcist: Believer' About?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>According to Weintraub in his Collider chat with the director, Green plans to continue the original story rather than remake it, with Leslie Odom Jr. the parent of a possessed child this time.</p><p>“Desperate for help, he tracks down Burstyn's character, whose young daughter (Linda Blair) was possessed by an evil entity known as Pazuzu in the first film,”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With Ellen Burstyn returning to her role, Leslie Odom Jr. joining the cast, and Green, Blum, and a whole team of others devoted to the project, audiences can be sure that the new trilogy will be a refreshing take on the story while keeping the essence of the original film.</p><p>Blum tells <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Den of Geek</a>,</p><p>“I want to make a movie that works for both [audiences]. I want to make a movie for people that know and love the first Exorcist and are furious that we’re doing this, but somehow drag themselves to the theater. I want them to come out happy. And I want to make a movie that people who’ve never heard of The Exorcist really enjoy. I think David did that with Halloween . I think he’ll do that with The Exorcist also.”</p><p>The official synopsis for the film reads as follows:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since the death of his pregnant wife in a Haitian earthquake 12 years ago, Victor Fielding (Tony winner and Oscar® nominee Leslie Odom, Jr.; One Night in Miami , Hamilton ) has raised their daughter, Angela (Lidya Jewett, Good Girls ) on his own.</p><p>But when Angela and her friend Katherine (newcomer Olivia O’Neill), disappear in the woods, only to return three days later with no memory of what happened to them, it unleashes a chain of events that will force Victor to confront the nadir of evil and, in his terror and desperation, seek out the only person alive who has witnessed anything like it before: Chris MacNeil.</p><p>For the first time since the 1973 film, Oscar® winner Ellen Burstyn reprises her iconic role as Chris MacNeil, an actress who has been forever altered by what happened to her daughter Regan five decades before.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibn6G5qrDEq2Wcp51kwamxjJ6vqKqTnsC1ecGeo6Kdppq%2Fbr7EpZyaq5VisaLAxGaamqukYr2tu9No</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-exorcist-believer-release-date-cast-plot.html&text=Everything%20We%20Know%20So%20Far&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-exorcist-believer-release-date-cast-plot.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-exorcist-believer-release-date-cast-plot.html&title=Everything%20We%20Know%20So%20Far" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-exorcist-believer-release-date-cast-plot.html&title=Everything%20We%20Know%20So%20Far" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-exorcist-believer-release-date-cast-plot.html&title=Everything%20We%20Know%20So%20Far" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-exorcist-believer-release-date-cast-plot.html&description=Everything%20We%20Know%20So%20Far" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-10-best-police-procedural-tv-shows-of-all-time.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The 10 best police procedural TV shows of all time">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./should-you-choose-trust-or-reward-for-the-senator-in-star-wars-jedi-survivor.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Should You Choose Trust or Reward for the Senator in Star Wars Jedi: Survivor?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
