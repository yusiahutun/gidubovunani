The tight curl pattern makes it difficult for natural oils from the scalp to travel down and coat a whole strand, often resulting in dryness. And while there are a plethora of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>natural hair care products</a> on the market to combat this, there's one ingredient that's unbeatable when it comes to keeping curls and coils hydrated: water.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That's why more and more people are on the hunt for the best hair steamer.

It boosts the efficacy of deep conditioners — especially for those with type four and low-porosity hair — and leaves users with softer, healthier strands. Plus, its dome is larger than most at-home steamers', enabling better coverage; still, it is compact enough to store easily.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As an added bonus, when you're finished with your hair, you can swap on the facial steamer attachment for a relaxing facial treatment.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-artist-hand-professional-hair-steamer></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Artist Hand Professional Hair Steamer</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you're really missing the salon experience, then this is the steamer for you.
