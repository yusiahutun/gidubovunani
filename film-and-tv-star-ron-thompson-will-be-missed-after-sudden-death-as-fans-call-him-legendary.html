He was a very congenial man with a warm and giving spirit, and was well-respected by many luminaries in the film and television industries.”</p><p>As well as friends and colleagues, fans have been quick to pay tribute too. “I am mortified,” one shared on <a href=#>Twitter</a>. “Pete [American Pop] is one of my favorite characters ever put on screen. Ron Thompson was an absolute legend, and his mannerism and movement as Pete were just legendary.”</p><p>The director of American Pop also took to the playform to pay his condolences: “We are deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Ron Thompson. Ron’s stellar performances as both Tony and Pete were critical to the success of American Pop. Ron was a true actor and friend.
