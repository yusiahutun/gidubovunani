Some people claim that the actual height of Tom Cruise is 170 cm (5ft 7 in), while on the other side of the watershed, it is stated to be 176 cm (5 ft 9 in). This does not make him one of the biggest celebrities and personalities in Hollywood, but his acting career stretches for miles.</p><p>For decades Tom Cruise was at the top of his career. He had the looks, the build, and the talent, and has starred in many award-winning and high-profit films. He is the face of the universally popular series Mission Impossible (MI), in which he plays the lead role of “Ethan Hunt” in the sci-fi movie. Cruise has been featured in all previous series and will also appear in the upcoming MI 5 series.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Zac Efron Height Weight Chest Waist and Biceps</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Tom Cruise Bio</strong></h2><p>Thomas Cruise Mapother IV was born on 3 July 1962 in Syracuse, New York in the United States of America. The 52-year-old comes from a family of German, English, and Irish descent. He was born of Thomas Mapother III, an electrical engineer, and Mary Lee, a teacher. After the death of his father in January 1984, 12-year-old Tom moved in with his stepparents, Joseph and Mary Lee Pfeiffer South.</p><p>He has three sisters: Marian Mapother, Lee Anne DeVette, and Cass Mapother.

With a height of 170 cm (5 feet 7 inches), Tom is not one of the greatest actors of all time. He is one of the below-average movie actors and producers. However, his performance as an actor and producer overshadows his actual height. If you would measure his career by height, Tom would certainly be a giant.</p><p>In the course of his acting career, he has played roles that would have been given to much taller actors, of course. A good example is his leading role in the series Mission Impossible, whose face he has become.

And that he is taller, especially at galas, photo shoots, and other gatherings,</p><p>Tom wears shoes that have a big sole. This makes him taller, which makes him look taller.

It seems that even celebrities, including Cruise, who have already made it and are worth about 350 million dollars, also have problems with their size.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Sampha Biography, Family, Dating, Quick Facts, Wiki</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Tom’s Weight</strong></h2><p>For his age, 52 years, Cruise is still a hunk, just like in his heyday.
