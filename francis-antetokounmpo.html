This move was instrumental in launching the basketball careers of his brothers, who were all born in Greece. The reason his parents moved to Athens was to seek out better employment opportunities and a higher quality of life.</p><p>Before that, his mom worked as a nanny while his dad was a handyman. When they relocated to Nigeria in the hopes of building a better life for their family, Antetokounmpo was left in the care of his grandparents.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Siblings></span>Siblings<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Giannis Antetokounmpo, the most renowned of the five Antetokounmpo siblings, is a part of the National Basketball Association (<a href=# rel=noopener>NBA</a>).
