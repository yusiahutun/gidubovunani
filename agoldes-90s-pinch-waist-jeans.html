And they came about through listening to customer feedback and behavior. "We introduced our 90's Loose Fit about four years ago, which we love for an easy classic straight, but noticed that when sized down, it also looks incredible," Agolde's design director, Erin Meehan, tells BAZAAR.com. "I was buying the 90's Loose in two sizes, as I loved having different styling options for my favorite washes—one that sits high and nipped in at the waist, and one that feels looser and boyish. We noticed that a lot of our customers were doing the same, and it was just a no-brainer."<br></p><p><h2 class="css-1e8n84v e1bddzxd0">AGOLDE AGOLDE Pinch Waist 90s Jean</h2></p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# aria-label="$198 at Nordstrom for AGOLDE Pinch Waist 90s Jean" data-href="https://www.nordstrom.com/s/agolde-90s-pinch-high-waist-straight-leg-organic-cotton-jeans-soundwave-vintage-indigo/6427202?origin=keywordsearch-personalizedsort&breadcrumb=Home%2FAll%20Results&color=465" data-product-url="https://www.nordstrom.com/s/agolde-90s-pinch-high-waist-straight-leg-organic-cotton-jeans-soundwave-vintage-indigo/6427202?origin=keywordsearch-personalizedsort&breadcrumb=Home%2FAll%20Results&color=465" data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=SyrN4SGJMyU&mid=1237&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fagolde-90s-pinch-high-waist-straight-leg-organic-cotton-jeans-soundwave-vintage-indigo%2F6427202%3Forigin%3Dkeywordsearch-personalizedsort%26breadcrumb%3DHome%252FAll%2520Results%26color%3D465&u1=har|xid:{xid}" data-affiliate-network='{"id":"e263d99a-3772-4907-9ae8-cde76366d01b","site_id":"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5","is_active":true,"details":null,"metadata":{"trackonomics":{"merchant_id":"689250","merchant_name":"NORDSTROM.com","network_name":"LS","network_id":"4","product_id":"459","product_name":"Harper&#39;s BAZAAR US","product_external_id":"459","product_url":null}},"network":{"id":"a332915a-6423-480f-9153-e3973f438607","name":"Trackonomics","is_active":true,"business_unit_id":"ad046b46-538b-42cb-aa54-c3d158875ed6","details":"","metadata":{},"created_at":"2021-11-04T18:15:18.481570+00:00","last_updated_at":"2021-11-04T18:15:18.481594+00:00"},"product_metadata":{"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5":{"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=SyrN4SGJMyU&mid=1237&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fagolde-90s-pinch-high-waist-straight-leg-organic-cotton-jeans-soundwave-vintage-indigo%2F6427202%3Forigin%3Dkeywordsearch-personalizedsort%26breadcrumb%3DHome%252FAll%2520Results%26color%3D465&u1={subid}","network_name":"ls","appended_link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=SyrN4SGJMyU&mid=1237&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fagolde-90s-pinch-high-waist-straight-leg-organic-cotton-jeans-soundwave-vintage-indigo%2F6427202%3Forigin%3Dkeywordsearch-personalizedsort%26breadcrumb%3DHome%252FAll%2520Results%26color%3D465&u1={subid}|xid:{xid}","last_updated_at":"2023-09-14 11:11:24.678074"}}}' data-vars-ga-call-to-action="$198 at Nordstrom" data-vars-ga-media-role data-vars-ga-media-type="Single Product Embed" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.nordstrom.com/s/agolde-90s-pinch-high-waist-straight-leg-organic-cotton-jeans-soundwave-vintage-indigo/6427202?origin=keywordsearch-personalizedsort&breadcrumb=Home%2FAll%20Results&color=465" data-vars-ga-product-brand=AGOLDE data-vars-ga-product-id=1668792e-1d4d-4227-9c83-ddb60b26d695 data-vars-ga-product-price=$198.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=b534e0c1-85e1-4761-a71a-9d3d85c9f05f data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand=AGOLDE data-vars-ga-product-sem3-category=Jeans data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-vars-ga-sku=6427202_37609859 data-vars-ga-magento-tracking=1 class="product-image-link ebgq4gw0 e1b8bpvs0 css-15xslai e1c1bym14"><img alt="AGOLDE Pinch Waist 90s Jean" title="AGOLDE Pinch Waist 90s Jean" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1642708221-90s-pinch-waist-navigate-1642708168.jpg width=3840 height=5760 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><h2 class="css-1e8n84v e1bddzxd0">AGOLDE AGOLDE Pinch Waist 90s Jean</h2></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The design is simple: "We started with the 90's Loose body and cinched in the top block, giving a more tailored fit.

While many have dedicated time and money to procuring the perfect vintage pair and hitting up their best tailor to execute a custom fit, this style takes the legwork out of achieving that end goal.</p><img alt="agolde 90s pinch waist" title="agolde 90s pinch waist" width=4380 height=6570 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/jls9hxrm-1642707806.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy</span><p>Agolde 90's Pinch Waist in Black Tea</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Light-blue classic vintage not your thing? The brand is leaning toward options with a range of colors and washes from black to distressed, dark to medium. "We wanted to make sure we had an assortment that ticked all the boxes for your wardrobe. Our Navigate wash, a classic mid-indigo, and our <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://agolde.com/products/90s-pinch-waist-high-rise-straight-black-tea data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Black Tea wash" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Black Tea wash</a>, a clean washed black, have been some standout washes over the past couple of seasons, and we'll continue to carry these into our new spring '22 collection," Meehan continues. "Outside of a range of clean washes, this fit is also offered in some authentically destructed washes including a notable new favorite—the 90's Pinch Waist in Rule."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Currently, the available size range is 22 to 34. We love this fit tucked into knee-high boots, with New Balance sneakers, and with socks and loafers. The jeans work with blazers or a simple black turtleneck as a (deliberate or not) homage to Steve Jobs. They're roomy enough to balance out a bodysuit, look cozy with knits, and are basically made for wearing with crisp boyfriend button-downs. "It's the perfect hybrid of a true vintage look but tailored for modernity and versatility," Meehan says. "It's really just That Jean that you can grab from your closet and it looks great with everything. I think it's important to have a no-fuss, failsafe pair of jeans no matter what look you're going for."</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/89754333-a030-4699-b9fa-0dfa137fc094_1496780517.jpg alt="Headshot of Kerry Pieri" title="Headshot of Kerry Pieri" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Kerry Pieri is Harper's Bazaar's Digital Fashion/Features Director.
