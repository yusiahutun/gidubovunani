You guessed it! Of course, we are talking about the lovely <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Winona Ryder</a>, who turns 44 today. Based on her incredibly youthful looks, we can only guess that the actress must have a pretty impressive beauty routine, considering we haven't seen her age a bit since her days shouting "Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Speaking of the original Beetlejuice film, the actress, who has starred in a steady stream of films over the years, has confirmed that her newest project is a sequel to the comedic fantasy film. Although the originalmovie is now 27 years old, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Ryder said</a> that the time gap hasn't stopped younger generations from catching on to the Beetlejuice craze.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since starring in Beetlejuice,the actress has had no trouble cementing her spot among Hollywood's finest. She's starred in many of our favorite films, including another Tim Burton movie, Edward Scissorhands (1990). Then, in 1993, Ryder won a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress and an Academy Award nomination in the same category for her role in The Age of Innocence.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This year has been equally busy for the actress, who, in addition to announcing the Beetlejuice sequel, was also crowned as one of the coveted faces for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Marc Jacobs's fall 2015 campaign</a> (below). And, based on the birthday girl's track record of acting success, we're guessing Ryder's just getting started in 2015.
