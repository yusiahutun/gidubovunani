You have to hit the stairs. It’s okay to learn, research, etc. As long as you are working, it will happen for you.”</p><p>These words have inspired many young women to give it their all and try to be the best that they can be.</p><h2><strong>Relationships</strong></h2><p>Supa Cent has always considered herself to be bisexual, although she states that she could never be with a woman because of all the games they play.</p><p>Still, that doesn’t stop her from loving women.</p><p>She hasn’t had the best luck with men.</p><p>She recalls in interviews being in love with an abusive man and had to get support in order to finally leave him while he was in prison.</p><p>Her bad luck didn’t stop there.</p><p>Supa Cent was engaged to a man named Lou.</p><p>They were together for quite some time, having had two kids together.</p><p>He was with her as she built her empire, and they appeared to be genuinely in love.</p><p>Unfortunately, Lou fell victim to a scam from someone claiming to be a 17-year-old looking for sex. Lou, victim/predator, communicated with this person through explicit texts that were eventually leaked to the public.</p><p>Being the boss she is, Supa Cent didn’t waste any time and dumped him in front of the world via Twitter.</p><p>After Lou, Supa Cent confirmed a rumor that she was dating Sage the Gemini. This went on for a few months before they split up.</p><p>Rumors say that Sage the Gemini didn’t have Supa Cent’s best interest in mind in their relationship.</p><p>There hasn’t been any more information on Supa Cent’s love life aside from brief rumors that she may be dating Talib.</p><p>Supa Cent quickly squashed those rumors.</p><h2><strong>Fiancé</strong></h2><p><strong>Update</strong> – in 2022, Supa Cent got engaged to her boyfriend, Rayzor.</p><p>The couple first met in 2019.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Hank Lockwood & Maria Ciuffo</a></p><h2><strong>Supa Cent – Net Worth</strong></h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-66020 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/what-is-Supa-Cent-worth.jpg.webp alt="what is Supa Cent worth" width=1100 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/what-is-Supa-Cent-worth.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-3 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-66020 class=wp-caption-text>@Getty</p><p>So, how much is Supa Cent worth?</p><p>Between her social media empire and The Crayon Box, Supa Cent’s hustle makes her deserving of every penny she has.</p><p>Supa Cent is a big creator on social media and makes a decent income from ad revenue and sponsorship, contributing heavily to her estimated net worth.</p><p>This is where she got her start.</p><p>When The Crayon Box came on the scene in 2017, that’s when she made her mark.</p><p>It is reported that she made $1m in 90 minutes with the launch of a new product in September 2018.</p><p>This incredible success is what makes Supa Cent’s net worth so remarkable.</p><p>Following her breakup with her fiancé, Lou, Supa Cent decided to pull a boss move and reward herself for all her hard work.</p><p>She purchased a multi-million-dollar mansion in Florida.</p><p>What makes this purchase so noteworthy isn’t the <a href=# rel=noopener>mansion</a> itself.</p><p>She filmed herself doing a purchase reveal, but before she ended the video, in true boss form, she walked over to the for-sale sign next door and took it down.</p><p>That’s right.</p><p>Supa Cent bought the property next door as well!
