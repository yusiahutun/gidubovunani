Have you got any idea who's behind the mask? We're taking a look at the top fan theories right now – and some of them might surprise you.&nbsp;</p><p id=eFKy0zIhRdy6 data-wc=12><strong>WATCH:&nbsp;Gargoyle and Squirrel battle it out in The Masked Singer US</strong></p><h2 dir=ltr>Who is Squirrel on The Masked Singer? Top fan theories&nbsp;</h2><h3 dir=ltr>Malin Akerman</h3><p id=eRUY5UduFTC9 data-wc=62>Squirrel is already a fan favorite, and viewers think they've worked out who she could be. So what's the top theory? It's none other than actress Malin Akerman. Famed for her roles in The Proposal, Rock Of Ages, Couples Retreat, 27 Dresses and Watchmen, fans are convinced that it's Malin, although other theories have included Cameron Diaz, Natalie Portman and Anne Hathaway.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8ebe55854aa2-malin-akerman-squirrel-z.jpg><p id=eWyGYTIIUxav data-wc=7><strong>Fans think that Malin Akerman is Squirrel</strong></p><p id=eJQoIlUhVI23 data-wc=42>Responding to a video of Squirrel's performance of 'Try' by Pink on Instagram, one user wrote: "That's definitely Malin Akerman, she was born in Sweden, competed as a figure skater for years, and made out with Tom Cruise in Rock of Ages."&nbsp;</p><p id=epDC0l0Ly_Or data-wc=34>Meanwhile, a second penned, "Malin Akerman from Rock of Ages. 100%," and a third agreed: "I could see Malin A - she was also a superhero in Watchmen.

Top fan theories</h2><h3 dir=ltr>Nick Jonas</h3><p id=eqpniuBABlMG data-wc=49>Gargoyle seems to be the one character that's kept everyone guessing this season. Sparking endless fan theories, the masked singer has been linked to Shawn Mendes, Marques Houston, Chris Brown and Jason Derulo, to name a few, but the common thread seems to be Jonas Brothers star, Nick Jonas.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/37ce46cb83af-nick-jonas-gargoyle-z.jpg><p id=e0m44l3j1d4Q data-wc=7><strong>Gargoyle is thought to be Nick Jonas</strong></p><p id=e_fUgQludISe data-wc=35>"I'm hearing Nick Jonas," a fan commented on Instagram.

Top fan theories</h2><h3 dir=ltr>Fergie OR Bishop Briggs</h3><p id=eszCEf-YKLI5 data-wc=43>Medusa has sparked a massive divide among fans, with many pinpointing Fergie as the masked singer, while others are convinced its Bishop Briggs.

I wasn't sure but I was listening this time instead of watching… and it's Fergie… I feel it… Buckingham Palace… Bridge.. London Bridge….," argued one.
