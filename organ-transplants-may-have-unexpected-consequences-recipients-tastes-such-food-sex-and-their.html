Some individuals experienced “new” memories, a heightened social and sexual adaptability, enhanced cognitive capabilities and spiritual or religious events.</p>Although these changes were regularly described as either neutral or beneficial, there were also accounts of distressing changes, including delirium, depression, anxiety, psychosis and <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">sexual dysfunction</span></a>.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">‘People become fear-based’: counselling lonely, depressed men in Hong Kong</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Several recipients have shared accounts of “memories” that appear to be disconnected from their own personal experiences. These memories often involve sensory perceptions that were apparently linked to their organ donor.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The paper highlights this example: “A 56-year-old college professor received the heart of a 34-year-old police officer who tragically lost his life after he was fatally shot in the face.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Following the transplant, the recipient reported a peculiar experience, stating, ‘A few weeks after I got my heart, I began to have dreams. I would see a flash of light right in my face, and my face gets real, real hot. It actually burns.’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/09/017065c4-1d5b-4eed-8512-c28a81672be3_73754221.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Theories to explain this and other experiences are varied.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Psychological theories suggest that the recipients’ personality characteristics can impact the organ transplant. For instance, it has been proposed that personality changes may stem from fantasies the recipient has regarding the donor and their organ.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Personality changes may also be attributed to the recipients’ use of defence mechanisms to cope with the stress associated with the transplant procedure.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">‘He saved my life’: prior donations get Chinese mum fast track new kidney</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Biochemical hypotheses suggest that the donor’s memories and personality traits may be stored in the donated organ and transferred to the recipient.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For instance, the authors say a memory trace or vestige of past experiences – an “engram” – may be transmitted from the donor’s brain to the recipient’s through exosomes, minute, saclike structures that originate within a cell and contain a selection of the cell’s proteins, DNA and RNA.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The idea of cellular memory transfer between donors and recipients, such as through DNA and RNA memory, has been suggested.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">A large percentage of people who received donations of organs other than a heart reported personality changesMitch Liester</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A biochemical mechanism involving the transfer of personality characteristics through the intracardiac nervous system, a system of neurons in the heart that uses chemical neurotransmitters to communicate and store information, has been mooted.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This system, also known as the “heart brain”, is believed to store memories that could be passed on to the recipient during transplant surgery, potentially altering their personality.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Another hypothesis involves the recipient’s electromagnetic field, suggesting that the donor’s personality information may be stored in the electromagnetic field of the donor’s heart and transferred during surgery, leading to changes in the recipient’s personality.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Family, doctors appeal for heart donation to save Hong Kong man’s life</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This theory might sound outlandish, but the human body is an electrical entity composed entirely of charged particles, governed by electromagnetism principles.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Mitch Liester, a medical doctor and an author of the paper, told the Post that two things about the study surprised him and his colleagues.</p>“A large percentage of people who received <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">donations of organs</span></a> other than a heart reported personality changes,” Liester said. “Many of these changes may have resulted from improvement in physical health following surgery rather than a transfer of personality from donor to recipient.”<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/09/04b0b0c8-2a8b-45ca-80fd-0580186a9eb2_90b6b600.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Another finding was not included in the paper, he noted.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Some individuals only partially completed our survey. In those cases, I called the people to see if they needed assistance finishing the study. When I spoke with them on the telephone and we got to know each other, they began revealing additional personality changes that they had not disclosed in the online survey.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">These changes paralleled changes that had been described by Paul Pearsall, an American neuropsychologist and author, who, in 1999, showed the many ways in which heart transplant recipients mirrored their donors’ personalities.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Heart transplant plea puts focus on Hong Kong’s lack of organ donors</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One of Pearsall’s most notable cases involved a five-year-old boy who was given a three-year-old boy’s heart.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The recipient shared: “I decided to name the boy. He is younger than me, so I call him Timmy. He had an accident when he fell down. It seems he really enjoys Power Rangers, just like I did in the past. However, I have lost interest in them now.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The recipient’s father clarified that neither his son nor the family were initially aware of the donor’s name or age. Eventually, they discovered that the donor was named Thomas, but his close family referred to him as Tim.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The recipient’s mother mentioned that they later found out Tim died after falling from a window ledge while trying to reach for a Power Ranger toy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/09/651349ea-3b70-465e-b963-5e222583e466_2e52fe38.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Pearsall suggested that memories, or traces of them, may be stored in different parts of the body. Sensitive transplant patients may exhibit personality changes that reflect their organ donors’ experiences.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLWmrcutn2avlaG5r7HSrGaaqqSesK2xjmxpbnBjZX1wu9GgmKdlpKeur7%2FPpZinrKNiuqLFjKGYr51dqrumxM%2Bemq2dlGKwsLrSnqiunZ6YsrR50Z6aoqiZmru1v4ytmKyslah6tMHCoWSfp5%2BZerSx12aYp5xdqbWmtdE%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./modadugu-vijay-gupta.html><span>←</span><span>Modadugu Vijay Gupta</span></a>
