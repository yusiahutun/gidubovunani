This was back in San Diego when I first started, and whenever L.A. comics came down to do a show, they told me to keep doing what I was doing.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckvay3h13003m3e6gueqja2nk@published data-word-count=10><strong>Describe your comedy in five words.</strong><br>Life of the goddamn party.&nbsp;</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckvay3h14003n3e6gj8iqxom0@published data-word-count=63><strong>What of your work do you think you’re best known for, and what of your work are you most proud of?</strong><br>I’d say my Lights Out set on David Spade. I’ve been proud of all of it at one point, but this feeling is short-lived. It’s like when a parent reminisces while looking at their adult child — they miss the 2-year-old in them.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckvay3h14003o3e6gr3fixyot@published data-word-count=38><strong>If there were a ’90s-style sitcom built around you and your material, in which you had to have a different job than comedian, what would be the title and logline?</strong><br>I ain’t giving y’all free IP, get outta here.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckvay3h15003p3e6glj3acw4q@published data-word-count=54><strong>What have you done for comedy during COVID that you thought you would never do?</strong><br>I performed in the window of the Comedy Store — that may have been my lowest point. To me, that was the comedy equivalent of a crackhead with a flashlight walking down the sidewalk looking for anything that resembles crack.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckvay3h15003q3e6g8xmoplnf@published data-word-count=76><strong>Who are some of your favorite comedians right now? Who is putting out work that excites and inspires you?</strong><br>I’m excited for what my friends are doing — some of the people that I started out with are at various stages of their careers, and I just love seeing that. I love the come-up. Tom Segura has been an inspiration of mine, just because of his approach to the game and the way that he treats people.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckvay3h15003r3e6ggi6xmmw3@published data-word-count=44><strong>What is the best comedy advice, and then the worst comedy advice, you’ve ever received, either when you were starting out or more recently?</strong><br>Best comedy advice: “There’s no wrong in writing, so always write.” Think that was Ralph Harris who said that to me.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckvay3h15003s3e6gkgybq9ro@published data-word-count=36>The worst comedy advice: I don’t recall any worst advice because&nbsp;I don’t listen to those people. I stricken that shit from the record. I only take advice from people I respect. I forget bad advice immediately.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckvay3h16003t3e6gzq3g7g35@published data-word-count=89><strong>Tell us one story from your childhood that is a good representation of your life.</strong><br>When I first asked my mother where babies come from, she said they came from the stork or the cabbage patch or some shit. Then I ran right to the library to look it up and found out where they really came from. I went straight to her and said, “They come from the mom’s ‘paginas.’” That was the only time she ever tried to bullshit me. After that, she always answered my questions directly.&nbsp;</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckvay3h17003u3e6g9ex6cu4c@published data-word-count=27><strong>What’s an embarrassingly earnest goal you have?</strong><br>To live out in the wilderness, far out from civilization — far enough that my nearest neighbor couldn’t hear a gunshot.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckvay3h17003v3e6goxhediwv@published data-word-count=46><strong>If you had the power to remove anything from the comedy world right now, from trends with material to how the industry operates, what would it be?</strong><br>It would be the unqualified gatekeepers. Why didn’t y’all ask me ten of these?
