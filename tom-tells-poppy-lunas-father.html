Steffy doesn’t think it’s fake. Hope guesses she only cares about pushing her brother toward any woman who isn’t her. Steffy tells Hope she’s doing what she always does, playing the Logan card… just like her mother. She won’t let her get into her brother’s head.</p><p><b>More:</b> <a href=# rel=noopener>Annika’s solution for Hope and ‘Thope’</a></p><p>In the design office, Thomas tells Ridge that Hope won’t commit to him for the rest of her life. Ridge asks, “So, you’re moving on to a woman who will commit.” Thomas says Paris was thrilled when he pulled out that ring. Thomas recaps that Hope’s rejection hurt and he didn’t know how he’d get past it, but the trip to France was exactly what he needed. It gave him the ability to have space and to cross paths with Paris. Ridge asks how Hope took the engagement. Thomas says she was thrown and upset, which is to be expected.<br><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Thomas-Ridge-BB-CBS_175353.jpg alt width=1024 height=598 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>At Bill’s place, Luna grills Poppy about keeping quiet about him being her father. She can’t help but wonder if there’s something else going on that kept her from telling her that Bill could be her father. Poppy expresses regret and Luna decides it doesn’t matter anymore. Poppy gushes about how happy it makes her to see her daughter happy and reunited with her father.</p><p>At Il Giardino, Sheila asks Tom if he’s excited and wonders if some of his old fans will show up when he plays tonight. Tom definitely wouldn’t mind seeing some faces from the past. Deacon teases that he should hire extra security in case women are rushing the stage. Tom chuckles but tells them he was quite a Casanova back in the day. Deacon muses, “Who knows, maybe you’ll get lucky tonight.” Tom thanks Deacon and hopes he won’t disappoint him. “You have no idea what this means to me.” Tom scuttles off and Sheila kisses Deacon’s cheek.<br><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Deacon-Sheila-BB-CBS.jpg alt width=1024 height=598 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>In the design office, Thomas muses, “Maybe I should have told Hope earlier.” But he wanted to tell her in person. He tells his father that Hope thought he came back to give their relationship another try.</p><p>In the main office, Hope insists that anyone who cares about Thomas should be concerned right now. This relationship with Paris is happening way too fast!<br><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hope-BB-CBS_36ff62.jpg alt width=1024 height=598 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>At Bill’s place, Poppy tells Bill it’s hard to believe now that she was so afraid of his rejection. “You’ve welcomed us into our home. You’ve changed our lives.” Bill would like to do more than that. He wants to welcome them into his family. Bill knows they have an intense bond and he respects that, but they can maintain their connection even if they took on another name. He wants Luna to be a Spencer by adopting her and making it official. Poppy gawps, “You would really do that?” Bill wants her to be his daughter in the eyes of the law. Poppy couldn’t imagine anything better. “I have never felt more connected or in love with a man.” Luna grins as they smooch. Poppy muses, “Oh, Luna Spencer. I like the sound of that.” Luna does too. Bill muses about a chance encounter at Il Giardino being so impactful. Poppy glances at the flyer about Tom’s show and decides Bill and Luna need some time alone together. She tells her daughter she know has the life she deserves and nothing and no one can ever take it from her. With that, she heads out the door.<br><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Poppy-Bill-Luna-BB-CBS.jpg alt width=1024 height=598 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Luna can’t believe she’s going to be an actual Spencer. Bill tells her if she ever gets tired of making dresses she’ll be welcome at Spencer Publications. Luna tells Bill that she never imagined someone as loving and accepting as him as her father. They embrace.</p><p><b>More:</b> <a href=# rel=noopener>Annika Noelle as you’ve never seen her!</a></p><p>At Il Giardino, Tom thanks Hollis for taking him under his wing. Hollis wants to see him succeed. Deacon appears and says they all do. He offers Tom his apartment to decompress before the show. Tom recaps that he was living on the streets, but he’s clean now, has a job, and is proud to be working at Il Giardino. He wants Deacon to know how much he values what’s going on here. “I’m going to give it my all up on that stage.” Poppy arrives and eavesdrops as Tom goes on about his bright future. He tells Deacon he’ll take him up on the apartment offer. “I promise I won’t trash it.”<br><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Poppy-BB-CBS_fb6a0f.jpg alt width=1024 height=598 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>In the design office, Ridge likes Paris, but he knows Thomas still has feelings for Hope, which is concerning. Thomas says she’s a woman who will not commit to him. He wants a family and wishes to give Douglas a brother or sister. Ridge grins as Thomas enthuses that he and Paris are on the same page. Thomas needs to go find Douglas and exits.</p><p><b>More:</b> <a href=# rel=noopener>Y&R couple crossing over to B&B</a></p><p>In the main office, Steffy tells Hope to let Thomas be happy. She couldn’t commit to him, so she shouldn’t begrudge him finding someone who will. Hope fumes that she couldn’t care less if her brother is happy as long as she’s not in his life. Thomas enters and Steffy invites him in. “I think you should hear this.”</p><p><b>More:</b> <a href=# rel=noopener>John McCook’s 80th birthday party</a></p><p>In Deacon’s apartment, Tom is strumming his guitar when a knock comes at the door. He calls, “Come on in, Boss!” Instead, Poppy walks in and informs Tom she’s putting him on notice. She didn’t appreciate his little trip to the Spencer mansion. Tom snarks, “What? Suddenly, you don’t like free pizza?” Poppy wants nothing to do with him. “Stay away from me. Stay away from my daughter.” Tom replies, “Our daughter. We both know the truth. Luna’s mine. I’m Luna’s father.”<br><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Poppy-2-BB-CBS.jpg alt width=1024 height=598 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><b>More:</b> <a href=# rel=noopener>Soap stars we’ve lost in first half of 2024</a></p><p>In the main office, Steffy tells Hope and Thomas she won’t be putting up with Brooke 2.0. “You are more and more like your mother every day and it’s painful to see because you were the one Logan I thought knew the difference between right and wrong.” Brooke ran through their family and now Hope is picking up where she left off. Is she being a little overprotective? Maybe. But it’s warranted given her brother’s obsession with her in the past. Steffy references all the conversations that she and Thomas had while he was in Paris. Now he’s happy. If Hope cares about him at all, she’ll leave him alone. Hope insists that all she’s done is question whether or not this engagement is right for Thomas. She doesn’t understand Steffy’s strong reaction. Steffy tells Thomas not to listen to Hope. He’s engaged and happy. He should marry Paris and not even think about Hope again.<br><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Steffy-Thomas-BB-CBS.jpg alt width=1024 height=598 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><b>More:</b> <a href=# rel=noopener>Preview!
