The fifth season last premiered on November 21, 2017.</span><p><span>For the show, another couple was shown three potential homes they may consider buying in central Texas.&nbsp;All houses need to be repaired and renovated.&nbsp;Joanna Haines designed it, at the couple’s option, with her husband as the prime contractor for the work.&nbsp;The buying couple typically has a budget of around $200,000, with a minimum of $30,000 estimated for renovations.</span></p><p><span>Joanna Gaines is said to have a design that tastes inch by inch simple and fresh yet timeless.&nbsp;She uses industrial pieces and has a specialty in making old things new.&nbsp;Above all, she is admired for seeing potential in projects, no matter how hopeless they may seem.</span></p><h2><strong><span>your parents and siblings</span></strong></h2><p><span>Joanna Gaines is of mixed ethnicity. Her mother, Nan Stevens, is Korean, and her father, Jerry, is half Lebanese and half German.&nbsp;Joanna is a Native American.&nbsp;Her parents have been married for over 45 years and Joanna Gaines has pointed to their relationship as a powerful inspiration for her own marriage.</span></p><p><span>While growing up, Joanna got a strong interest in business while helping her father run his tire shop.&nbsp;The couple only had three daughters, so Gaine’s only siblings are her sisters – one named Mary Kay McCall and the other Teresa Criswell.&nbsp;The designer has been working on a house for her sister, Mary Kay, which appeared on the fifth season of the Fixer Upper show.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Joanna’s husband, children and divorce</span></strong></h2><p><span>Joanna Gaines appears to be very happily married to Chip Gaines with no divorce on the horizon.&nbsp;They tied the knot in 2003 and have been partners in the truest sense of the word ever since.&nbsp;They had actually both attended Baylor University but had never met each other at school.&nbsp;The first time they met was at Joanna’s father’s house after Chip’s car had a brake failure.&nbsp;They were soon together and in love.</span></p><p><span>Every couple has their rough times, rumors of divorce crept in long ago when Chip Gaines momentarily left the business for a Spanish immersion program in Mexico.&nbsp;He was there for three months and during that time Joanna Gaines had sole responsibility for her business.&nbsp;However, the rumors were never confirmed and have since died down.</span></p><p><span>Together they have five children named Emmie,Duke, Ella, Drake and Crew.&nbsp;Crew Gaines, her current last birth, was born in June 2018.&nbsp;With her large family, it’s not surprising that Joanna Gaines not only runs her business, but also lives a simple life on the farm where she relaxes.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGiin5a7r62MoJiippWoeqO1zmacraCenrCqwNhmmKCdXZi1qrjDq5ynZaCWv6a606xkrKGSobavs9Jmm6Kun6ewpns%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjoanna-gaines-bio-ethnicity-age-children-parents-siblings-divorce.html&text=Joanna%20Gaines%20%20Bio%2c%20Ethnicity%2c%20Age%2c%20Children%2c%20Parents%2c%20Siblings%2c%20Divorce&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjoanna-gaines-bio-ethnicity-age-children-parents-siblings-divorce.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjoanna-gaines-bio-ethnicity-age-children-parents-siblings-divorce.html&title=Joanna%20Gaines%20%20Bio%2c%20Ethnicity%2c%20Age%2c%20Children%2c%20Parents%2c%20Siblings%2c%20Divorce" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjoanna-gaines-bio-ethnicity-age-children-parents-siblings-divorce.html&title=Joanna%20Gaines%20%20Bio%2c%20Ethnicity%2c%20Age%2c%20Children%2c%20Parents%2c%20Siblings%2c%20Divorce" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjoanna-gaines-bio-ethnicity-age-children-parents-siblings-divorce.html&title=Joanna%20Gaines%20%20Bio%2c%20Ethnicity%2c%20Age%2c%20Children%2c%20Parents%2c%20Siblings%2c%20Divorce" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjoanna-gaines-bio-ethnicity-age-children-parents-siblings-divorce.html&description=Joanna%20Gaines%20%20Bio%2c%20Ethnicity%2c%20Age%2c%20Children%2c%20Parents%2c%20Siblings%2c%20Divorce" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./sidney-aoibheann-carlton-mccauley.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Meet Sidney Aoibheann Carlton-McCauley  Photos Of Vanessa Carltons Daughter With Husband Joh">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./its-been-pretty-rocky-90-day-fiance-star-liz-woods-discusses-ups-and-downs-of-relationship-with-big-ed-amid-marriage-rumors.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Its been pretty rocky: 90 Day Fiance star Liz Woods discusses ups and downs of relati">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
