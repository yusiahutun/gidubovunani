The internet is becoming more complicated day by day, containing a wide range of information that is beyond our imagination. Because of the complexity of this network system, our minds can get anxious because of so much content we don’t know and, don’t have control over. This worry becomes even more when we run into, the news about the dark web. But the question arises here, what is the dark web, and what is its impact?</p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>What Is The Dark Web?</h5><p>The dark net is the world wide Web content that is a hidden collective of the internet that can accessed with specialized web browsers only. This can be useful for both legal and illegal applications as it is used to keep internet activity private. Although the dark web forms a small part of the deep web, this part of the web is not like the “Visible” part of the internet like Google or Facebook, which can be indexed easily by search engines. Sometimes people use the deep web and dark web interchangeably. But these terminologies are different from each other. Deep web refers to the information that is available on the internet and can be easily found by users like Google.</p><p><strong>Also Read: </strong><a href=#>Relationship Between Crime & Trauma in India</a></p><p>On the other hand, the Dark web or darknet, a subset of the deep web can be accessible only to specific networks such as Tor( the onion routing)<br>There are certain internet layouts and key terms to better understand the dark web.</p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>What is a surface web and a deep web?</h5><h6 class=wp-block-heading>Surface web</h6><p>The surface web or open web is also known as the visible surface layer.

This collection of websites and data makes up 5% of the total internet.</p><h6 class=wp-block-heading>Deep web</h6><p>The deep web or deep net, is hidden and is not visible to day-to-day internet users. It comes under the World Wide Web but rests underneath the surface web. The accessibility to the deep web is not through the normal search engines, as its access is around 0.3% percent of all the information available on the internet. Most of the deep web portion is legal and safe. It mainly includes:</p><ul><li>Databases</li><li>Intranets</li><li>online banking</li><li>social media apps</li><li>forums</li></ul><h5 class=wp-block-heading>What is a Tor browser?</h5><p>The onion routing (Tor) was developed to keep US communications safe from dangers.
