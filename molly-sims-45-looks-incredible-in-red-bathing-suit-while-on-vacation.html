But one sight that was turning heads was Molly in her red bathing suit. The Kentucky native also sported some sunglasses to add to the whole look.</p><p>In fact, a little while ago Molly told&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Closer</a> how it is that she stays so fit. “Food is protein and vegetables. I do drink, I drink wine,” Molly explained, adding that when it comes to alcohol and sugar, “You have to cut it out at some point. You can’t just — I mean, I don’t cut it out, but I definitely limit it.” Molly added, “I am a big believer in wellness and taking care of yourself, and I do believe that you’re your own best advocate. I research, I find things, I try things, I get talked into things — but it’s good, and I like different things!”</p><p><strong>And it’s certainly paying off. Have a look at the photos below to see Molly living her best life, and looking the part as well.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46mpqWkqWLAqrnSZmtuZZykvKy%2FjKKlnKqVmbajuMRmoKdlopqxbq7ArZ%2BippdiwLa102auoaGcmnqwuoyvmJyZpJ68r3s%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./article-09138c3e-86bb-515e-8992-7b93be9fd836-html.html><span>←</span><span>Korea hits home | Columnists</span></a>
