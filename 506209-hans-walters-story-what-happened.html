The man, who was not identified until the next day, claimed the following:</p>I am going to see his house on fire and harm any police officer that comes to the home.<p class=align-left>The man was identified as 52-year-old Hans, an off-duty lieutenant from the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department in Nevada.</p><h4 id=506209-stand-off-with-the-police-officers class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Stand-off with the police officers</h4><p class=align-left>When the Boulder City police officer arrived at the crime scene, they saw the lieutenant standing in the doorway of his house.

Immediately, the Boulder City and Henderson fire department were called to the scene, where they successfully battled the blaze.</p><p class=align-left>The SWAT officers were called to the house, where they entered and found three bodies. Later, Sherriff Douglas Gillespie from the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police, where Hans Walters worked, confirmed the killings. He offered reassurance to the grieving families and friends of the victims, stating:</p>We will stand by your side, move through this unspeakable grief, and support you any way we can.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/074730d8274f6d05.png><h4 id=506209-professing-innocence-and-disbelief class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Professing innocence and disbelief</h4><p class=align-left>Just before the entire house rose in flames, one of Walters' neighbours stated that Hans professed innocence in his final moments.
