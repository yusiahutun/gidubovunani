As we all know that Matt&nbsp;has been monotonously rumored as a gay. Reasons and facts to support this statement&nbsp;aren’t&nbsp;available,&nbsp;however, extensive&nbsp;research on this topic leads to the&nbsp;conclusion that such rumors are nothing but a hoax.</p><p style=text-align:justify>At least, it should be assumed so, unless otherwise shows up.&nbsp;No&nbsp;single proof (or sighting) of Matt being romantically linked to a person of the same sex has been found yet.</p><p style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-199 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><strong>See Also:-</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Paula Faris Leaves 'The View' & 'GMA' For Bigger Fish At ABC News</a></p><p>We speculate that all these gay rumors are caused by someone who likes to deduce&nbsp;people based on their looks. If not so, a gay fan may be pulling the strings on his computer.</p><p><span style=color:#000>Well, Matt has dodged all the rumors away as he is now blissful family life along with his dearest wife and kids.&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Family Man With Blissful Family Life</h2><p>The&nbsp;personal life of this handsome figure surely deserves&nbsp;to be addressed. For all the girls out there who dreamt&nbsp;of being his girlfriend, this apparently&nbsp;comes as&nbsp;sad news. Those&nbsp;of you who follow Matt on his social networking accounts might be familiar with the fact&nbsp;that he is a married man, in fact, a happily married man. However, it appears as if he is trying to conceal his wife's identity from his followers. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-600 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>His wife has been tagged in most of his Instagram posts from where it can be seen that&nbsp;this <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Emmy Award winner</a> and his wife are blessed with a son and a daughter. As we discussed, Matt seems to be trying to conceal his wife's name. His wife has an Instagram account under the name <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Daphida</a>&nbsp;and has the name 'Daphna' on the info bar.</p><p><strong>Read Also:-</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>ABC's Jim Avila Keeping Old Age Love Alive!
