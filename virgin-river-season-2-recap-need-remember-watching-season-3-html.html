Season<strong> </strong>3 of the <a href=#>Netflix</a> drama arrives on July 9, and fans can’t wait to find out what’s next for Mel (Alexandra Breckenridge), Jack (Martin Henderson), and the rest of the residents of Virgin River — especially after <a href=#>season 2’s cliffhanger ending</a>. Before you jump into season 3, here’s a quick refresher on where things stand with the show’s main characters.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-jack-was-shot-in-the-virgin-river-season-2-finale>Jack was shot in the ‘Virgin River’ Season 2 finale&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/VirginRiver_Season3_Jack.jpg><p id=par-2_45>Just in case you somehow forgot, Virgin River Season 2 ended on an explosive note that left the fate of a fan-favorite character up in the air. In the closing moments of the episode, Mel arrived at Jack’s bar and discovered that he’d been shot.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_100>Who shot Jack — and why — is a question the finale didn’t answer, but there are a few contenders. It could be Jack’s <a href=#>military buddy Brady</a> (Ben Hollingsworth). In season 2, the two clashed over Brady’s involvement with a local drug kingpin, Calvin (David Cubitt). Calvin himself is another possible suspect, as he hasn’t taken kindly to Jack’s meddling in his business. Or someone we’ve never met may have pulled the trigger. In any case, it appears that Jack does survive the attack, and that much of season 3 will focus on figuring out who was <a href=#>behind the shooting</a>.</p><h2 id=h-charmaine-is-done-with-jack-maybe>Charmaine is done with Jack (maybe)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Virgin-River.jpg><p id=par-4_52>Charmaine (Lauren Hammersley) and Jack’s relationship was tense throughout season 2. After learning <a href=#>his ex was pregnant</a> at the end of season 1, the former Marine stepped up to do the right thing and support her. But he made it clear he didn’t want to rekindle their romance, much to Charmaine’s disappointment.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_83>As Jack and Mel’s romance heated up, Charmaine got increasingly frustrated. She even considered moving to Portland to live with relatives, even though that would make it difficult for Jack to see his babies. (Charmaine is expecting twins.) In the season finale, she told Jack that she wanted to be married, and that if he wasn’t willing to settle down with her, she’d find someone who would. She also implied she’d cut Jack out of his childrens’ life if she married another man.</p><p id=par-6_22>“The man I eventually marry will be the twins’ father, and we’ll just have to see where you fit in,” she said.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-doc-is-sick-preacher-takes-on-a-big-responsibility>Doc is sick, Preacher takes on a big responsibility&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/VirginRiver_Season3_Preacher.jpg><p id=par-7_89>In the second season of Virgin River, Hope (Annette O’Toole) and Doc (Tim Matheson) finally reconciled after years of estrangement (though they were never officially divorced). Doc even “proposed” to Hope again, and she accepted. But in the finale, he revealed that he’d been to see a doctor and received some bad news. Unfortunately, before he could tell her what it was, they were interrupted by their friends who’d thrown them a surprise engagement party. (The <a href=#>season 3 trailer</a> offers some hints about what might be wrong with Doc.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_124>Virgin River Season 2 also featured a big development for Preacher (Colin Lawrence). Initially, it seemed like he was prepared to leave Virgin River to take a prestigious job at a restaurant in San Francisco. But then, a friend of Michelle’s (aka Paige, played by Lexa Doig) showed up in town with Michelle’s son. Earlier in the season, Michelle accidentally killed her abusive husband and Preacher helped her cover up his death. Michelle left town, but by the end of the season, her husband’s twin brother (Steve Bacic) had tracked her down. Preacher ended up agreeing to take in Michelle’s son, though based on the trailer for the new season, it seems he has some trouble adjusting to his new role as a father.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_9>Virgin River Season 3 is currently streaming on Netflix.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-10_7>Check out <a href=#>Showbiz Cheat Sheet</a> on Facebook!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTDqr7GoqVmqpmrsrN50p6YrKeeYn9uvsScmKllnpqypXnRnqSepZKav27DwK2aoaGenHq0scCspqdlY2O1tbnLaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kano-real-name-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>What is Kano's real name and what is his net worth?</span></a>
