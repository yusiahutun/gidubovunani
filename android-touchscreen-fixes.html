Combined with its delicate glass build, it's no surprise that smartphone touchscreens are one of the most common components to run into issues.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But the touchscreen not working on your Android phone isn't always the result of a hardware failure. If your phone touchscreen often isn't working or fails to respond, there's a lot you can do before getting professional help.</p><p>Here are a few fixes to try if your Android touchscreen is not working.</p><h2 id=is-your-phone-39-s-touchscreen-really-broken>1. Is Your Phone's Touchscreen Really Broken?</h2><p>First, you should rule out the possibility of a software bug if your phone's touchscreen is not working. There are a handful of troubleshooting steps you can do to confirm this.</p><h3 id=reboot-your-phone>Reboot Your Phone</h3><p>A good old reboot might sound futile to fix such an advanced issue. However, it's often one of the most successful ways to fix an unresponsive touchscreen on Android. <a href=#>Restarting your phone can fix most problems</a> as it shuts down and refreshes all background services, which could have crashed and led to your issue.</p><p>Press and hold the <strong>Power</strong> button to display the power menu, then tap <strong>Restart</strong> if you're able.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you're unable to touch the screen to select the option, on most devices, you can hold down the <strong>Power</strong> button for several seconds to switch off your phone. In some cases, you may need to hold down the <strong>Power</strong> button and the <strong>Volume Up</strong> button at the same time.</p><h3 id=boot-into-safe-mode>Boot Into Safe Mode</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/01-android-power-menu.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/02-reboot-android-safe-mode-popup.jpg> <span class=txt>Close</span><p>If your touchscreen is not working, but only intermittently, then you may be able to <a href=#>re-boot your phone into safe mode</a>. Android's safe mode lets you use your phone with only the original software it shipped with, which strips out all services and apps you've installed. If your display works normally in safe mode, a third-party app is likely at fault here.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To enter safe mode on most new Android devices, press and hold the power button. In the resulting prompt, touch and hold the <strong>Power off</strong> or <strong>Restart</strong> button. Once you see the prompt to enter safe mode, tap <strong>OK</strong>, and your phone will soon restart. To exit safe mode, just restart your phone normally.</p><h3 id=diagnose-your-display>Diagnose Your Display</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/display-tester-android-app.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/display-tester-android-app-1.png> <span class=txt>Close</span><p>If you're scratching your head wondering, "Why is my phone touchscreen not working?" you'll find a range of apps in the Play Store that could help you to diagnose your display issues. These are designed to pinpoint what exactly is wrong with your phone's touchscreen. We recommend trying out one simply called Display Tester.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When you launch Display Tester, head into its <strong>Tests</strong> tab. Here, you have the option to test a whole bunch of aspects. The app can detect dead pixels, burn-in on OLED screens, whether the contrast and saturation are accurate, multitouch status, and more.</p><p>If you got positive results in touch-based tests, you should review all recently installed apps or consider performing a factory reset. Since your touchscreen functioned as intended under special circumstances, a third-party app is most likely the root cause.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Display Tester</a> (Free) | <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Display Tester Pro Unlocker</a> ($0.99)</p><h2 id=remove-the-screen-protector>2. Remove the Screen Protector</h2><p>Many people apply a screen protector on their phones as an added safety against drops and scratches. We also recommend it as one of the <a href=#>ways to avoid breaking your phone</a>. But that same sheet of plastic or glass could prevent your touch signals from reaching the display panel, making your Android touchscreen unresponsive.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If your phone's screen has been acting up lately, try removing the protector. Of course, this doesn't guarantee a fix. However, it could increase the response rate on an already weak screen.</p><h2 id=artificially-improve-the-screen-39-s-latency>3. Artificially Improve the Screen's Latency</h2><p>For partially functioning displays, you may be able to enhance the screen latency with a third-party app.</p><p>Touchscreen Repair is a lightweight app that calibrates your screen to reduce response times. The app asks you to consecutively tap several sections of the touchscreen. Based on your phone's internals, it then artificially drops the latency as much as possible.</p><p>The effectiveness of Touchscreen Repair varies depending on your phone maker. Many OEMs ship their phones with optimal response rates. In those scenarios, Touchscreen Repair won't be able to do much. But it's worth a try if nothing else has worked yet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Download:</strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Touchscreen Repair</a> (Free, in-app purchases available)</p><h2 id=control-your-phone-with-voice-or-facial-movements>4. Control Your Phone With Voice or Facial Movements</h2><p>You don't have to rely on touch inputs to control your phone. To better serve users with accessibility needs, voice and facial-based interaction methods for Android have come a long way.</p><p>With the right apps, you can navigate on your phone entirely through your voice and facial movements. Of course, these solutions only apply if your phone's touchscreen works enough to install an app from the Play Store.</p><p>Otherwise, you can try <a href=#>installing the app on your phone through the Play Store web interface</a>. And you can disable touchscreen input on your phone until you get the screen fixed.</p><h3 id=voice-access>Voice Access</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/01-android-accessibility-settings.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/02-voice-access-settings-android.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/03-enable-voice-access-popup.jpg> <span class=txt>Close</span> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Google's Voice Access app proactively listens to your commands and assigns a number to every action available on the screen. Instead of touching an app icon or menu element, you just have to call out the assigned digit.</p><p>In Google's Pixel series phones, Voice Access is pre-installed. Access it by opening the <strong>Settings</strong> app and navigating to <strong>Accessibility > Voice Access</strong> and toggling on <strong>Use Voice Access</strong>. You can download it on other phones.</p><p>Voice Access links fundamental actions to fixed phrases. So you can say "screen down" for moving around pages and "go back" to return to the previous screen, for example.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Voice Access</a> (Free)</p><h3 id=eva-facial-mouse-pro>EVA Facial Mouse Pro</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/eva-facial-mouse-1.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/eva-facial-mouse-2.png> <span class=txt>Close</span> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This app does exactly what its name suggests. It adds a virtual cursor on your screen, which you can manipulate with your face. To move the pointer, you simply have to move your head in the appropriate direction.</p><p>When the cursor is over the element you want to select, wait for a moment or two to input a single tap. You also have the option to switch on a dock for quickly accessing a handful of essential actions, including home and multitasking. The app also allows voice input, so enable that if you need it.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">EVA Facial Mouse Pro</a> (Free, in-app purchases available)</p><h2 id=pair-an-external-keyboard-and-mouse>5.

This assumes you can still see the screen, though.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Controlling an Android phone with an external keyboard and mouse</a> is mostly straightforward. All you need to do is find the right cable and plug the accessories in. Since your phone has one USB input, you will need a dongle to pair both of them.</p><h2 id=water-accident-let-it-dry>6. Water Accident? Let It Dry</h2><p>It's important to understand <a href=#>the difference between water-resistant and waterproof</a>. A water accident can permanently damage your phone's internals if you leave it on. Thus, in such scenarios, your best course of action is to shut down the device and wait for it to dry. Contrary to popular belief, <a href=#>rice is not a good way to dry out your phone</a>.</p><h2 id=if-all-else-fails-visit-a-service-center>7. If All Else Fails, Visit a Service Center</h2><p>With these possible fixes, you should hopefully be able to revive your phone's touchscreen if it's just a software bug. Failing that, the apps mentioned can grant you a temporary workaround.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Otherwise, you will have to visit a service center for help. If you're lucky, a professional will be able to restore your Android phone's touchscreen functions, although depending on the device, it may be a pricey repair. If not, you'll have to look at replacing your phone.</p><p>To save another trip to the service center, you should also ensure the rest of your phone's components are working well.</p><h2 id=fix-the-unresponsive-touchscreen-on-your-android-phone>Fix the Unresponsive Touchscreen on Your Android Phone</h2><p>Your Android touchscreen might not be working for various reasons. Hopefully, one of the fixes above helped solve your touchscreen issues. If everything fails, perhaps it's time to upgrade.</p><p>Smartphones don't last forever.
