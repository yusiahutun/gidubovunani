However, Soaps.com may receive a commission on orders placed through its retail links, and the retailer may receive certain auditable data for accounting purposes.</p><p>Fans have been bracing themselves for the&nbsp;Station 19 series finale ever since the news broke that the show had been canceled, but what they’re not ready for is another death. With Maya Bishop (Danielle Savre) in imminent danger, fans are worried that beloved firefighter might not make it out of the episode alive. Keep reading to see <a href=# rel=noopener>if Maya Bishop dies in</a> Station 19&nbsp;and how the character’s story will end.</p><h2>Does Maya Bishop die in Station 19?</h2><p>Though fans won’t know whether Maya dies in Station 19 until the series finale on May 30, 2024, fans on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> claimed that ABC accidentally spoiled Maya’s fate by uploading a photo of her on the network’s press site before promptly taking it down. “They took down the picture with Maya in it lmao,” a Reddit user wrote two days before the series finale. Another user also claimed that Station 19 spoiled Maya’s ending by showing her alive in the preview for the finale. “I think they forgot that they spoiled Maya is okay last Thursday with that promo video ahahah,” a user wrote.</p><p>In the penultimate episode, the team got called to help prevent a wildfire from reaching Seattle. They were maintaining the line successfully for the first half of the episode, but things took a turn for the worst in the final few minutes.</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">promo</a> for the season finale opens with Maya separated from the rest of the group and surrounded by flames. She then radios in to the team and tells them: “I’m scared, I don’t think I’m getting out of here.” Maya isn’t seen in the rest of the clip and later on, Natasha Ross (Merle Dandridge) can be heard saying: “We are down a firefighter.” In the comments section, several fans reacted to the danger Maya is in and wondered if she will get killed off. “Maya better get out of there,” one fan wrote. Another commented: “Carina’s finally pregnant and Maya needs to get out alive.” A third fan wrote: “I swear to god if Bishop dies I’m gonna to riot because she is my favourite character and if she dies I’m going to cry and scream all at the same time.”</p><p>One fan theorized that Maya will be okay, writing: “I don’t think Maya or anyone will die. I really don’t think the show runners will end it that way and upset the fans. I do think that after this wild fire we will see most of the team go there separate ways while Andy leads the new probies and creates her own legacy at 19.” This theory definitely has legs, as the episode’s official description reads: “As Station 19 continues to battle a wildfire, the team grapples with the possibility of a future that will be changed forever.”</p><p>Although this could be alluding to death of a Station 19 family member, we suspect it has to do with the station facing a changing of the guard. The episode prior, Vic Hughes (Barrett Doss) revealed that she is going to move to Washington,&nbsp; D.C. to run her Crisis One program. She even asked Travis Montgomery (Jay Hayden) to come with her, but fans have yet to hear his answer. The episode also saw Ben Warren (Jason George) grapple with whether he’d make a better firefighter or doctor given his shoulder injury, seemingly hinting that he <a href=# rel=noopener>could return to Grey Sloan Memorial</a>.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>More:</strong> See if Ben Warren will return to Grey’s Anatomy after Station 19 Ends</a></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Maya-Bishop-Station-19.jpg alt width=1341 height=782 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Maya’s wife, Carina DeLuca (Stefania Spampinato), could also potentially return to Grey’s Anatomy, and given how invested fans are in this couple, it’s highly unlikely that the show would kill Maya off, especially if there’s a possibility of continuing their relationship on the flagship series.</p><p>Although Maya will most likely be fine, the same can’t be said for Theo Ruiz (Carlos Miranda), who is most likely the firefighter that Ross is referencing in the promo. Theo was a former Station 19 member and the Interim Captain before Andy Herrera (Jaina Lee Ortiz) was appointed to the position. He resigned early on in Season 7 to help alleviate some of the budget issues the station was facing. Theo was hired to help out with the wildfire and was injured while saving Travis from a falling tree. Although it’s unclear if he is going to die, his injuries are extensive and include an open femur fracture, internal bleeding and a fractured pelvis. The team rushed him to the medevac and watched as he was airlifted out of the flames, his fate unknown.</p><p>Fans will just have to tune into the series finale to see how Station 19 will end and which character’s will survive.</p><p>Station 19 is available to stream on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Hulu</a>.</p><p><strong>For more on Station 19, check out our gallery on <a href=# rel=noopener>who the cast is married to and dating in real life.</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmrKeRpcBwusSwqmhvY2d%2FeoCOppiymV2ZtqZ50q2YraGfo3pyhY4%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmaya-die-station-19.html&text=Does%20Maya%20Bishop%20Die%20in%20Station%2019%3f%20What%20Happens%20to%20Danielle%20Savre%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmaya-die-station-19.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmaya-die-station-19.html&title=Does%20Maya%20Bishop%20Die%20in%20Station%2019%3f%20What%20Happens%20to%20Danielle%20Savre%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmaya-die-station-19.html&title=Does%20Maya%20Bishop%20Die%20in%20Station%2019%3f%20What%20Happens%20to%20Danielle%20Savre%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmaya-die-station-19.html&title=Does%20Maya%20Bishop%20Die%20in%20Station%2019%3f%20What%20Happens%20to%20Danielle%20Savre%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmaya-die-station-19.html&description=Does%20Maya%20Bishop%20Die%20in%20Station%2019%3f%20What%20Happens%20to%20Danielle%20Savre%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./how-to-make-tree-in-little-alchemy-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How to make Tree in Little Alchemy 2">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./branford-pediatrician-sexually-assaults-20-year-old-female-patient-during-medical-exam-police.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Branford Pediatrician Sexually Assaults 20-Year-Old Female Patient During Medical Exam: Police">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
