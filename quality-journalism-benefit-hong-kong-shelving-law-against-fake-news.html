The decision is welcome.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The administration has listened to community concerns about risks to press freedom and free speech, especially from the media industry. A fake news law could have opened a Pandora’s box of complications for these fundamental rights.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Around the world, such laws have proved problematic and are mostly used as a tool to control the media.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">That is not to say fake news and the social division and mischief it creates have subsided; quite the reverse. But free societies can and must find other ways to deal with them.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Fake news laws are difficult to draft and inevitably restrict press freedom. It is good that the government has recognised this.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/26/65ab7e34-7d8d-44ac-8eed-b84a18820b15_4849cc24.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There are already laws that apply to the more serious forms of disinformation, including a new offence of spreading false information under the Article 23 domestic national security law. There is no need for further restrictions.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Misinformation and disinformation also can be dealt with by non-legal means – such as a concerted community effort to educate readers to be more discerning in their consumption of news and opinion.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu this week said Hong Kong did not need a fake news law because the media industry had improved and practitioners’ “self-discipline and professionalism” could curb the circulation of falsehoods. “We should go for this as the first option,” Lee said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Secretary for Justice Paul Lam Ting-kwok, revealing earlier that fake news was off the legislative agenda, said “very difficult legal questions” surrounded key definitions of the law.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">That said, the fake news phenomenon has only spread and become worse since it played havoc with the World Health Organization’s global anti-pandemic campaign.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Hong Kong leader John Lee says no need for law targeting fake news</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The government should lead a community-wide effort to reduce its impact through education in simple, basic steps to filter news you can trust, starting from the age when youngsters become serious consumers of news. It has become known elsewhere as media literacy or information literacy training.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In this respect Hong Kong has a lot of work to do.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the digital age, keeping trust in what we read, see or hear is a challenge to the media industry itself. Professionalism – especially fact-based journalism and resistance to the quest for clicks – is a sound basis for safeguarding press freedom.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Shelving a fake news law is not just good politics, but good for the healthy development of the whole media industry and for quality journalism. These are the best defences against the insidious evil of fake news.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kvLG1zaKmp2eRp8Gqr8ueZmxqZmWAeoCOqqyapJmpxm62zq6pp5mcnsCuecGepZ6emal6qbvNoGSkp56cerS0xKWtoqaXYrmiw4yanpqhnqjBbrLApJxmppWswA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./meaning-of-invisible-by-5-seconds-of-summer.html><span>←</span><span>Meaning of Invisible by 5 Seconds of Summer</span></a>
