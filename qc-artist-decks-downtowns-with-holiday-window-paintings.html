Enter once or multiple times for a chance to win.</p><p><strong>“A joy to work with”</strong></p><p>“Atlanta has been a joy to work with and is truly a part of what makes the QC great,” DBO executive director Ryan Jantzi said this week. “Her artwork is instantly recognizable and helps strengthen the soul of our community.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2022/12/AD25.png><p>The artwork in downtown Bettendorf was concentrated mostly on Grant Street with a few businesses on State Street. Businesses on Grant were chosen mainly because State Street gets the benefit of holiday lights on the decorative poles in downtown Bettendorf, he said.</p><p>Grant Street does not have the same poles for lights, “so her artwork helps spread some holiday cheer to those businesses,” Jantzi said.</p><p>This is the second year Dawn has painted holiday window displays in downtown Bettendorf and Davenport, but the first time Bettendorf has had the “12 Days of Christmas” theme and contest.</p><p>“This year, I wanted to make it more unique and cohesive,” she said recently. Several of the Bettendorf businesses are the same as last year.</p><p>You have to enter by commenting on your photos on <a href=#>the Downtown Bettendorf Facebook page</a>.</p><p>Though Dawn painted many downtown Moline windows for the 2021 holiday season, she didn’t this year, and worked with Moline High students, who painted a “Holiday Hop” scene on the former RiverStone building at 1701 5th Ave.</p><p>Dawn also again did windows at Freight House in Davenport, at Front Street Taproom and Chill Ice Cream & Eats.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2022/12/AD24.png><p>She did 14 downtown Bettendorf windows between Nov. 28 and Dec. 4, and two of those days were below freezing. “It was a lot of fun,” Dawn said. “I’ve gotten a lot of great, positive feedback from the community, while I’m doing it – thanking me or saying, ‘This is so amazing. I’ve never seen a window painter in action.’”</p><p>In September, she sought requests to have windows painted for the season, which she usually starts Nov. 1. She tried to have Davenport windows done before the start of Festival of Trees.</p><p>“I had endless companies messaging me to do work for them and I had to turn away so much business,” Dawn said. “My calendar was already full. Davenport and Bettendorf made sure in October they nailed me down.”</p><p>The DDP reimburses partial payment for downtown Davenport businesses to use Dawn.</p><p><strong>“A big impact”</strong></p><p>“Atlanta made a big impact in downtown Davenport and we’re so pleased to see her work expand all over the Quad Cities the past couple years,” said Kyle Carter, executive director of Downtown Davenport Partnership. “Her work is instantly recognizable, and we love her festive vibes.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2022/12/AD13.png><p>“Businesses have been extremely pleased with Atlanta and her artwork,” Bettendorf’s Jantzi said. “The DBO will be working to add even more businesses in the future.”</p><p>Downtown Bettendorf Business Women commissioned the ornament featuring the new I-74 bridge artwork of Brad Bisbey with proceeds benefiting families in need and scholarships.</p><p>Dawn said her holiday window displays will be up until mid-February.
