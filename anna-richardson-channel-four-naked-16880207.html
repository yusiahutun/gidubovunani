<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Tellys Anna Richardson reveals her naked truth</h1></header><section class=post-content><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article15136520.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Anna-Richardson-725356><p>The host of Channel 4’s nude dating show Naked Attraction, which is back tonight, has found out her mother – an RE teacher, no less – tuned in for the final of Love Island.</p><p>“I’m appalled,” Anna tells me. “She didn’t even have a ****ing clue what was going on.</p><p>“She only watched it because it had been talked about in The Guardian and on Radio 4."</p><p>It’s not that Anna is jealous, mind you, of Love Island’s success. And you sure as hell couldn’t call her a prude. No, it’s way simpler than that: Anna just hates that show, full-stop.</p><p>“It’s diametrically opposed to Naked Attraction,” she argues. “In an age where we have chronic problems with mental health, particularly with young people and social media, I think it’s divisive.</p><p>“Plus it encourages the idea that it’s OK to betray in order to get your man – and to get your man for money.”</p><p>So how, in comparison, would she sum up her own show – where a picker chooses from six stark naked potential dates, each stood inside a coloured pod, revealing only bits of their body at a time.</p><p>“I like to think it’s a bit like Strictly Come Dancing.” Really?</p><p>“Yes, I know that sounds odd, but I mean in the sense that it’s cross-generational and sort of family viewing, weirdly.</p><p>“It’s also funny. We’re not laughing at people, we’re absolutely laughing along with them, and the fact they’ll say the most honest, straightforward things about bodies and sex.”</p><p>But there are other aspects to the show Anna feels are important.</p><p>“It opens a conversation around gender identity and sexuality. We’re dealing with a society now that’s far more open in that respect.</p><p>“I think now on Facebook there are something like 71 different identity categories. Admittedly, that’s absurd, and for an older generation it can get confusing. But there’s also a massive part of me that thinks, ‘Get with it!’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article15150433.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Anna-Richardson-and-Mike-Ward-1432240><p>Excited OK, and what about people who watch Naked Attraction for more, err, basic reasons?</p><p>“It’s not pornographic,” she stresses. “It’s not sexual in any way. No one’s getting turned on.”</p><p>"Well, almost no one. Anna does admit later that some of the male contestants have occasionally become a bit, shall we say, “excited”.</p><p>“We’ve had a couple of times when we’ve had to say, ‘In the red pod, fella, d’you want to just go to the loo and calm down…?’ But, hey, it’s just a biological urge.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article15136522.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Anna-with-her-dog-1432242><p>Anna’s own sex life has frequently hit the headlines, particularly when it emerged that, after 18 years with her previous partner, TV director Charles Martin, she’d begun a new relationship with ex-Bake Off host Sue Perkins.</p><p>Sue, she’s keen to stress, is a very private person. But Anna is not, which I guess could make life tricky at times.</p><p>It seems she’ll pretty much talk about anything, however personal: her religious upbringing, her hormonal issues, nearing the menopause, the fact she’s on anti-depressants, the huge peacock feather tattoo on her back.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article15154320.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Anna-Richardson-with-Mike-Ward-1432245><p>“I’m an over-sharer,” she admits.</p><p>“But I don’t give a s**t. I’m nearly 50, I’d rather be direct and honest.”</p><p>Anna once declared that women are “much more difficult to have a relationship with”.</p><p>Awkward again, surely.? “Well, again I have to be really careful and stress I’m not talking about Sue. But I can absolutely talk about myself.”</p><p>And the same applies, I take it, when she talks about being keen to adopt?</p><p>“Yes, for me it’s something I’m very conscious of. I can’t have children myself, but I’m really open to the idea of having a family. And these days, those come in all shapes and sizes.”</p><p>So what sort of mum would she make?</p><p>“I actually think I’d be quite strict, certainly with manners and not indulging them. But who knows?</p><p>“Having seen the way I’ve brought up my dog, the chances are I’d let them do whatever the hell they wanted!”</p><p>As for the relationships forged by Anna’s dating show, there’s at least one Naked Attraction couple still together: Gemma and James from series one. Wedding bells before long, do we think?</p><p>“Don’t joke, Mike! I’m desperate for a Naked Attraction wedding. I can’t wait to buy my hat!”</p><p>Star’s favourites:</p><p>FILM: Forrest Gump</p><p>TV SHOW: The Handmaid’s Tale</p><p>SONG: The Winner Takes It All (Abba)</p><p>ACTOR: Elizabeth Moss</p><p>CITY: Edinburgh</p><p>HOLIDAY DESTINATION: Ibiza</p><p>GADGET: Hand-held laser for hair-removal</p><p>APP: Audible</p><p>ANIMAL: My dog Tig</p><p>COMEDIAN: Alex Horne</p><p>SPORTSPERSON: Rio Ferdinand</p><p>BOOK: The Goldfinch (Donna Tartt)</p><p>FOOD: Yes, please</p><p>DRINK: Absolutely</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKuYpMSjtdlomKemkWK%2Fqq%2FHmqmdq5%2BjeqS0wKelnqRdm7y2voynmKSdlGJ%2Bd4SXaWlpbw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./marty-york.html><span>←</span><span>Marty York</span></a>
