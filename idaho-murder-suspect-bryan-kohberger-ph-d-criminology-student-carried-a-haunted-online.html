The 28-year-old man is being held for allegedly killing four students, namely Madison Mogen, 21, Kaylee Goncalves, 21, Xana Kernodle, 20, and Ethan Chapin, 20. Currently, he has been listed as a PhD student at Washington State University. <a href=#>Kohberger</a> has been pursuing a doctorate in criminal justice in Pullman. Notably, the record shows that a man with the same name is also listed who received a Master of Arts in Criminal Justice from DeSales University in 2022.</p><p>Apparently, the suspect had released an online questionnaire on Reddit while working on his research paper in an attempt to understand the psychology of criminals. He wrote, “My Name is Bryan, and I am inviting you to participate in a research project that seeks to understand how emotions and psychological traits influence decision-making when committing a crime.” Kohberger continued while urging criminals to contribute to his study, “In particular, this study seeks to understand the story behind your most recent criminal offense, with an emphasis on your thoughts and feelings throughout your experience. In the event that your most recent offense was not one that led to a conviction, you may still participate.”</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>'To Catch a Predator' host Chris Hansen says Idaho killer is 'young' and 'obsessed' with one of the girls</a></p><p><a href=# rel>'Easier to be proactive': Slain Idaho students' neighbor Jeremy Reagan gives DNA test to avoid suspicion</a></p><p>In this haunting survey, he concluded his message by mentioning, “Additional surveys are included after the open-ended section as to best understand your unique traits. The study should take about 15-20 minutes to fully complete.”</p><p>He assured participants that their identity will be kept completely confidential, and the survey link is anonymous too, “Your identity and all answers provided are completely confidential, and the link to the survey is also an anonymous link. This research had been approved by the DeSales University IRB.”</p><p>The survey included questions such as, 'Did you prepare for the crime before leaving your home?', 'Why did you choose that victim or target over others?' and 'What was the first move you made to accomplish your goal?' 'After committing the crime, what were you thinking and feeling?' Some of the other questions asked from the criminal participants were, ‘Before making your move, how did you approach the victim or target?’ and ‘After arriving, what steps did you take prior to locating the victim or target?’</p><p>As of now no one from Kohberger’s family or the university commented on his arrest. Also, authorities are still trying to establish whether he had any connection with four victims who died on November 13, killing. The police are yet to clarify the reason why they suspected him at first. According to the source, the officials have been keeping an eye on his movement and finally tracked him down from his family home, in Pennsylvania. The Moscow Police Department is likely to give more insight on the arrest in a press conference today.</p><p>Disclaimer: This is based on sources and we have been unable to verify this information independently</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRooZSWtbB5zK6pnZ2iYsC2v8%2Bemq1lkqfGorqMpKahmpWntKa%2BjKmfZpxdmL%2BqucinpqWnl656tMDUnZynrF2YrrO%2ByJ6bZpldna62utOem2annqG2r7E%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./golshifteh-farahani.html><span>←</span><span>Golshifteh Farahani Biography</span></a>
