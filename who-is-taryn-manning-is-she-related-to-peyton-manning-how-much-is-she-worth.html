Black</span><span>&nbsp;(2003-present).&nbsp;The one-time member of Sexiest Women, who also posed nude for Playboy Magazine, is also a singer who performs as a solo artist and as one half of the electronic group Boomkat.&nbsp;That’s not all there is to know about Taryn Manning and what she’s known, however.&nbsp;If you were stung by her last name or maybe saw some of her works and you really think this lady is worth knowing, here we will serve you all the hot details of this celebrity, including its monetary value.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Who is Taryn Manning?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Taryn Manning was born as the second child to her parents;&nbsp;Bill Manning and Sharyn Louise on November 6, 1978, in Falls Church, Virginia.&nbsp;When he was about two months old, Manning’s parents divorced.&nbsp;She and her older brother, Kellin, were raised only by their mother, who had moved from Virginia to Arizona.</span></p><p><span>The family found life very difficult as they lived in a trailer park and were on a very low/strict budget.&nbsp;However, this did not prevent her mother from enrolling her in karate, dance and acting lessons in the hope that she could make a career out of it.&nbsp;While things were going well, Manning became a state champion in karate for her age group as she also excelled in dancing.&nbsp;Around the age of 12, the family moved to San Diego, California, where she attended middle school and high school.&nbsp;Meanwhile, Manning was able to find work as a waitress and barista to further support her family as she continued to hone her acting skills in preparation for her big break.</span></p><p><span>During the 1990s, Taryn Manning landed small roles in episodes of shows such as The Practice, Get Real, NYPD Blue, Popular, and Boston Public.&nbsp;At the turn of the millennium, she made her film debut in&nbsp;</span><span>Follement beau</span><span>&nbsp;(2001) then appeared in&nbsp;</span><span>Carrefour</span><span>&nbsp;(2002),&nbsp;</span><span>8 miles</span><span>&nbsp;(2002) and&nbsp;</span><span>Laurier Blanc</span><span>&nbsp;(2002).&nbsp;In 2003, she and her brother formed an electronic and pop music group called Boomkat.&nbsp;The group, which was supposed to sign a recording contract with American Idol producer Randy Jackson, eventually turned to DreamWorks Records, which released its debut album titled Boomkatalog.One in March 2003.</span></p><p><span>Manning was building a Hollywood reputation around this time as she started appearing on the covers of different magazines and was ranked as one of the sexiest women by several publications.&nbsp;Despite this relative success, Manning was still searching for her breakthrough/blockbuster role that would define her career.&nbsp;It finally came to pass in 2005, when she was cast as a prostitute named Nola in the movie Hustle & Flow, which earned her nominations from the Screen Actors Guild Awards, the Washington DC Area Critics Association, and at the Black Reel Awards.</span></p><p><span>Taryn Manning has since gone on to appear in&nbsp;</span><span>Jack and Jill Against the World</span><span>&nbsp;(2008),&nbsp;</span><span>The Devil’s Grave</span><span>&nbsp;(2009), and&nbsp;</span><span>The Job</span><span>&nbsp;(2009) as she embarked on a solo music career, releasing songs like “Turn It Up”, “Send Me Your Love” and “Summer Ashes”, among others.&nbsp;In the early 2010s, Manning seemed to fade away as she strove to land major roles.&nbsp;Her fortunes then turned when she landed the role of Doggett from Tiffany “Pennsatucky” in Netflix’s Orange Is the New Black.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Is Taryn Manning related to Peyton Manning?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Taryn Manning and Peyton Manning, the retireesThe American football player considered one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time is his secondary cousin.&nbsp;Her father, a late musician, was a first cousin of Peyton’s father, Archie.</span></p><p><span>It’s unclear if Taryn and her Super Bowl-winning parents;&nbsp;Peyton or her younger brother Eli have a relationship where the only thing that connects them is blood and a name.</span></p><h2><strong><span>How much is it worth?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Taryn Manning is said to have a net worth of around $3 million.&nbsp;The 5ft 2in (1.575m) actress and singer who grew up in a park was able to get rich through her career as an artist.&nbsp;His roles in Orange include New Black which guaranteed him big salaries, as did his music, some of which reached No. 1 on the Billboard Dance Club charts.</span></p><p><span>Manning has also had a very successful entrepreneurial career, as she owns a clothing line called Born Uniqorn and a record label called Little Vanilla Records.</span></p><p class=postsid
