Giving props to his partner in crime Joe Keery, Gaten gushed, "Of course. Of course. It's awesome. Working with Joe [Keery] is always incredible, and he's a dear, dear friend. And I love all the stuff we get to do." Furthermore, talking about how the bromance came out of the blue, Matrazzo continued, I think what's great is like it just kinda, oddly enough, it came naturally, I think, in a weird way."</p><p>"When we found out we were gonna be working together, it was more of a way to transition from not really having much to do, being at a dead-end plot-wise, for both of our characters and needing a reason to get to the junkyard in Season 2," the 19-year-old actor elaborated before concluding, "We needed a reason to get us to meet up with you [points at Sadie Sink aka Max Mayfield] and Caleb [McLaughlin aka Lucas Sinclair] and they had no idea how to do it. And I guess they could go together because Dustin needs a ride, and it grew from there wonderfully. And it's always been such a pleasure working with him."</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><h2><strong>Watch Gaten Matarazzo, Sadie Sink and Priah Ferguson's EXCLUSIVE interview for Stranger Things 4 below:</strong></h2><p>Dustin and Steve FTW!</p><p>Which is your favourite Dustin Henderson (Gaten Matarazzo) and Steve Harrington (Joe Keery) bromance moment in Stranger Things?
