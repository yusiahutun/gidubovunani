Margot Brennan graduated a year before Steve, the duo remained inseparable, eventually tying the knot in 1990 — four years after they were in a relationship.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Margot Kerr’s family:&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span>Her children</span></strong></h2><p><span>On September 15, 1990, Margot and Steve attended a private wedding of only close friends and family in Ohio.&nbsp;As previously mentioned, the couple was founded by Bruce Fraser.&nbsp;Margot once mentioned in an interview that Bruce probably thought they would get along well because they are both nerdy.&nbsp;Even while dating, the couple stuck together, defying the long distances and constant moving that was becoming the norm for Steve.</span></p><p><span>Margot and Steve Kerr’s marriage has produced three children – Nicholas Kerr, Madeleine Kerr and Matthew Kerr.&nbsp;Two of their children – Nick and Maddie, as they are affectionately known – took care of their father and became basketball players.&nbsp;Nick played college basketball for San Diego University and is now video assistant for San Antonio Spurs, while Maddie is an excellent basketball and volleyball player.&nbsp;She was a top performer at Tory Pines High School and then the University of California.&nbsp;She also won two San Diego Division section championships.&nbsp;Madeleine, a graduate in media studies and rhetoric, is currently practicing as a paralegal.</span></p><p><span>Matthew “Matt” Kerr decided to take after his grandparents, who were writers.&nbsp;He enriches the world with his talent as a writer, and he’s doing quite well at it.&nbsp;His father once described him as smarter than all of them.&nbsp;He mentioned that Matt is a really great writer and has even written screenplays.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Interesting facts about Steve Kerr’s wife</span></strong></h2><h4><strong><span>Net worth of Margot Kerr</span></strong></h4><p><span>It’s an undeniable truth that Margot came to the limelight solely because of her husband, Steve.&nbsp;As the head coach of the Golden State Warriors and a former, well-decorated professional basketball player, Steve has made an impressive income and made a name for himself in the field.&nbsp;He has won eight NBA championships – three as a coach and five as a player.</span></p><p><span>As a head coach, his salary is estimated at around $5 million while his net worth is estimated at around $18 million.&nbsp;As of now, nothing is known about Margot’s net worth, salary or career.</span></p><h4><strong><span>She ensured a stable home front and thus promoted her husband’s career</span></strong></h4><p><span>Born in Tucson, Margot Kerr did not allow the burdens associated with constant travel and relocations due to transfers to her husband’s homeland.&nbsp;She has been very supportive of him and is in fact his biggest fan.</span></p><p><span>Even at this moment, as the father of her three children, is the head coach, she constantly engages with Warrior fans on social media.&nbsp;She obviously enjoys notoriety as the wife of the Golden States Warrior head coach.&nbsp;This is evident in the numerous tweets and banters she exchanges with fans on Twitter.</span></p><h4><strong><span>Your body measurements and statistics</span></strong></h4><p><span>Margot Kerr is a naturally slim woman shorter than her famous husband who stands at 6ft 3in in height.&nbsp;Although her exact body measurements such as weight, bust, hips, waist and shoe size are not known, we do know that she rocks her blonde hair well and has beautiful brown eyes.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><span class=vce-square></span><h2 class=entry-title><a href=# title="Who is Cassandra Marino?
