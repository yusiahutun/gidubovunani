No one could deny his talent. Nashawn’s departure from this world has left an immense void in my life, one that words cannot fully express.</p><p>“I can’t put into words the pain and hurt that I feel. He was not just my son; he was a remarkable man whose character and strength inspired all who crossed his path.”</p><p>Rapper Mickey Factz shared a video of Breedlove rapping in 8 Mile on <a href=#>Instagram</a>.</p><p>He added to the post: “RIP to one of the few emcee’s to beat Eminem… Lotto from 8 Mile. Who’s friends lovingly called him, OX. You will be missed for your tenacity and aggressiveness.”</p><p>Before the <a href=#>Hollywood</a> movie, Breedlove was also by the stage name OX.

Ultimately, he loses.</p><p>Reports also say that he was one of the few rappers in the movie to write their own rap.</p><p>Fans who were there for the scene also said he was a “cool dude” and made his part his own. Others felt he had actually “won” the rap battle with Rabbit. Although in the flick, Rabbit is crowned winner of the showdown.</p><p><strong>You can <a href=# rel=nofollow>watch</a> the clip here.</strong></p><p>Breedlove’s former girlfriend, Latisha Harper, who shared a son with the star also commented on his death. She said he was “so humble” and “didn’t even know he had true fans”.</p><p>She added: “He was so talented. Not only Wa (sic) he an amazing MC he sang better than Luther. He blessed me with my son @youngzaak and I swear that is Nashawn to the 10th power. I will always be his biggest fan. If y’all only knew his talent 🙌 please pray for our strength, it is needed.”</p><p>His son, Zaak, 22, shared a photo from his dad in the movie in a tribute.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-tributes-pour-in>Tributes pour in</h2><p>Fans, friends and family members paid tributes to the star.</p><p>One wrote: “My best friend and brother since 15 years old.

He was in a group called The Now. Illest group of emcees I’ve ever met in my friggin life.</p><p>“They SMOKED my group in a showcase competition but they was humble and cool. Ox stood out. Super good dude. I lost touch with him before 8 Mile. I had high hopes for that man. Sad to hear this news. May he RIP.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlxX2eFcMDRmp6enKlirrR5l2akoqSVYq6kwM6rZJqmlGK%2ForzPnqlmnJmawG6%2F1J2bnqacrnqquoyhoKxlo6GypryMmqtmoJ%2BisnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kate-middleton-the-queen-tiaras.html><span>←</span><span>The Lover's Knot tiara shares a fascinating link with the Queen's most iconic crown</span></a>
