Initially, absolutely. In 2009, when they're like, 'Amber Rose — Kanye's girlfriend,' I was like, 'OK, that's pretty accurate. That's what it is,'" she told the site, referring to West's latest single, <strong>"Famous."</strong></p><p>"But I didn't ask to be famous, and I didn't even talk or do interviews for two years, because I thought, I don't want this. I'm not famous," the 32-year-old revealed. "Over time, with going out in public, I realized it would never go away, so I didn't have any choice but to progress."</p><p>"Everything I've done since then is my own doing, and I've worked my f--king ass off for everything I have," she continued. "But Wendy Williams put Charlamagne on. Jay Z put Kanye on. But they don't do that to men, and they always want to diminish my accomplishments and put them on someone else when I work really hard."</p><p>Since dating West, Rose has definitely made headlines on her own accord with her annual <strong><a href=#>SlutWalks</a></strong>. Not to mention she's appeared on a number of TV shows -- from <strong>"Inside Amy Schumer"</strong> to <strong>"Black-ish"</strong> - and will be getting her own talk show on VH1 later this year.</p><p>But when it comes to Rose's past relationship with the <strong>"Gold Digger"</strong> there are certain things she isn't delving into. When asked about whether he cheated on her with him or whether he was ever abusive, Amber shut it down.</p><p>"Oh, I'm not talking about that. I am not talking 'bout that," she said. "I'm not talking about Kanye at all. I understand why you're asking me that — you're just doing your job — but I'm not going there."</p><p>What do you think about the outspoken star's candid comments?
