The ex-wife of action hero Bruce Willis, and once the highest-paid actress in Hollywood, said 'Yes' to karate teacher Oliver Whitcomb after he popped the question a month back.</p><p id=eYBSRPXqnfm1 data-wc=68>A friend told the US media that Demi, who enjoys a simple rural life in the Idaho town of Hailey, far removed from Hollywood, is over the moon. "It all happened so quickly. Oliver shocked Demi by proposing out of the blue," said a friend of the couple. "He got down on bended knee over a candlelit dinner at their home and produced a stunning three-carat diamond ring."</p><p id=eCHcmsaZidl8 data-wc=41>However, Oliver, 31, got nervous after he saw a tear roll down his girlfriend's face. "He asked her if there was anything wrong," continued the source. "Demi paused and then cracked up laughing. She assured him: 'I've never been so happy.'"</p><p id=eO0OaQKA95Ru data-wc=85>Her ex-husband was one of the first to find out, and came out to Hailey to celebrate the good news at a big American Independence Day party in Hailey on July 4. The <i>Sixth Sense</i> star is overjoyed for his ex and told a friend that he's given the couple his blessing. "He told me, 'I just want her to be happy,' said the friend. "'She and I will always have a special relationship. She's the mother of my children and nothing can alter that.'"</p><p id=enzr-CzhsQP2 data-wc=79>The green-eyed beauty, 38, is expected to marry Oliver, who she met when he gave her daughters martial arts lessons, at her Idaho mansion this October. She was recently spotted in Las Vegas, shopping for a wedding veil and tiara at Fred Leighton Jewellers in a smart hotel. "Demi looked like she was walking on air," said an onlooker. "She was down to earth and friendly, chatting to the sales assistants." She stopped short of discussing wedding details, however.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
