<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Remote Amazon tribe tries to straddle two worlds to protect their way of life</h1></header><section class=post-content><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Even after the disappearance of the plane – from which the Amazon must appear as little more than a dark green carpet – a feeling of unease remains.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Waiapi only came into contact with the Brazilian government in the 1970s. To this day, they exist much as their ancestors did before Europeans arrived in South America five centuries ago, living in harmony with the planet’s biggest rainforest. But the outside world is getting ever closer.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At first glance, life in Manilha and dozens of other tiny settlements of thatched, open-sided houses appears to be from another age.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Men hunt and fish, bare-breasted women harvest cassava and tend the fires, and all, from young children up, smear themselves in the natural dyes that the Waiapi believe protect both body and soul.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There are no shops, there’s no need for money. Unlike tribes that have become almost tourist attractions, the Waiapi rarely accept visits by outsiders, even journalists. Yet you don’t have to look as far as the sky for signs of change.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">The children don’t like it in town. They have to wear clothes and take showersMonin Sa, Waiapi woman</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One tribesman has a phone stuck in his loincloth that he uses to take pictures, even if there is never a signal here, while another owns Manilha’s only car, despite currently lacking petrol. From under a thatched roof comes the blaring of a solar-powered VHF radio, used to connect Waiapi villages scattered through the forest.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And while Manilha gives the appearance of being lost in the throbbing heart of the rainforest, everyone knows that really the industrialised 21st century is no more than two hours of rough driving south in the sleepy town of Pedra Branca.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Many of the around 1,200 Waiapi almost never visit Pedra Branca, but Jawaruwa Waiapi travels there every week, switching between two worlds like a time traveller.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The 31-year-old, who lives up a steep hill of dense jungle, made history last year by becoming a city councillor. He is the first of his tribe to win an elected post – a rare example of a Waiapi plunging fully into what they call the “white man’s” territory.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In Pedra Branca, Jawaruwa Waiapi wears jeans and a neat checked shirt, and sits behind a desk.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“You have to follow the rules of the city. Here you need money to live, you need to pay for everything,” he says. “Back in the village you don’t pay for anything: water is free, the firewood is free.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Returning to Waiapi lands later that day, he strips down to the traditional loincloth. His wife Monin, dressed similarly, smears him in urucum and he returns the favour.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Jawaruwa Waiapi says he ran for office because there was not one indigenous person on the council, just as there are no indigenous lawmakers in the national Congress. He asks: “Who else will fight for our people?”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Marina Sa, who owns a restaurant in Pedra Branca and has helped the councillor integrate, says Jawaruwa Waiapi’s presence is just as novel for the Brazilian locals.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Few people have gone [to the Waiapi territory],” he says. “It’s a separate world.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/10/28/874f530e-bba5-11e7-affb-32c8d8b6484e_1320x770_173416.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A burden seems to fall from Jawaruwa Waiapi and his family when they return to their tribe, where the loudest sounds are bird calls and the sun governs daily routines.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The children don’t like it in town,” says his wife Monin, 24. “They have to wear clothes and take showers [rather than bathe in the river].”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But, looking down at his four-year-old son – one of four children – Jawaruwa Waiapi worries.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Many young are sent to study and usually they come back, but what if they don’t?</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“If he goes out beyond the village and ends up liking cities, he’ll never want to have the Waiapi people’s culture,” Jawaruwa Waiapi says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One tribesman who left for 20 years and returned says it took him four years to become “a full Waiapi again.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“There’s a lot of evil in the world,” Calbi Waiapi, 57, said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But for Kamon Waiapi, who travels regularly to Pedra Branca as an assistant to Jawaruwa, the key to survival is remembering who you really are.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Joining journalists on a ride into town, Kamon Waiapi exited the car at the outskirts and removed his red loincloth, slipping on a pair of jeans, leather shoes and a polo shirt.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Now I’m a white man,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Did the clothes make him feel less Waiapi too?</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“No,” the 25-year-old answered without hesitation. “Inside, I never change.”</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Amazon tribe straddles two worlds</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miuqKqcmXyiucSroJyZo2Sus8DInKOeZ2JmfniAkWxmq52dpMGmecCmmLOnnmLBs7XBnmStqpmawG6%2F06uYnZycmnq1w85mrqiqnJnAbrzRqKuem6RiwamxyKtksJmp</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./carmela-zumbado-boyfriend-relationship-status.html><span>←</span><span>Is Carmela Zumbado Dating James Scully?
