1,700-home development were to go ahead, the population of Alderholt would more than double.</p><p>A Dudsbury Homes spokesperson said: "The development will be transformative for the local area, providing much needed housing and facilities for local families."</p><p>Alongside almost 2,000 homes a modern medical centre will be built, improvements to the local school made and a new six-day hourly bus service from Cranborne-Alderholt-Fordingbridge-Ringwood brought in.</p><p>The spokesman added: "Hopefully it will enable younger people to get on the housing ladder.</p><p>"The proposals will also support new business opportunities in Alderholt through a new 10,000 sqm employment hub that will provide a multitude of opportunities.</p><p>"New serviced office space and fibre internet will also make it easier for people to work from home."</p><p>Adrian Hibberd, chairman of Alderholt Parish Council, confirmed that <a href=#>Dorset</a> Council had received the proposal and said he had seen Dudsbury Homes' "wishlist".</p><p>He said he's waiting to see something "in black and white" before taking a stance on the plans, adding: "Until an application comes forward we're not having a view as such.</p><p>"There are more developers than just Dudsbury Homes trying to do the same thing at the moment.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN
