Alternatively, they can pay between 6 yuan and 98 yuan to enjoy ad-free connections for seven days or up to 180 days, according to the app.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">N2ping is a similar app developed by Zhengzhou Lonlife Technology. It offers a 24-hour free trial and charges as much as 899 yuan for premium annual membership, which provides a 10 Mbps connection which even allows overseas users to connect to local Chinese game servers with uninterrupted play.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Mainland-born Susan Ma has lived in Hong Kong for almost 10 years, but is finding it increasingly important to have a mainland IP address so she can connect with her daily entertainment, like TV series, movies, and sports games.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/10/15/bec790fc-b002-11e7-9cb1-5f6b75e2d8b2_1320x770_122607.JPG>“I am a soccer fan, but Hong Kong television stations charge a lot of money for the package. It is completely different from the mainland where TV stations and their apps always broadcast these programmes free of charge. So I have been searching for ways to ‘return to the mainland’ for the free and most up-to-date programmes,” Ma told the South China Morning Post.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In recent years, mobile apps in China have also bought broadcast rights to popular sports games to broaden their user base. Tencent Video, the mobile video-platform backed by Shenzhen-based technology giant Tencent, bought mainland Chinese online broadcasting rights for the 2016 Rio Olympics, as well as several popular European Football Leagues.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Transocks and N2ping apps are not available on Apple’s app store for China because the US tech giant removed VPN software in July to comply with Beijing regulations.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A lawyer in Shanghai, who asked for anonymity, said it is not illegal to develop VPN software but added that anybody who uses such software in China may be committing an offence.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“But in this case, Chinese rules are not applicable to overseas users, and as long as their respective local laws allow them to use these apps in their respective countries, there won’t be any issue,” the lawyer said.</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Overseas Chinese climb firewall to view TV favourites</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwaavx2iaoaGelnq1scKhZpqqpJ6wrbGOa2hqbWJshXDAx56qnmWRpb20ec%2Buq2ato5q%2FtHnBnp%2BippRisKm1zZqqZqGeqbKzusStZJ%2BhoprEorjLZpyvnZ5iuqq4y6Kmp6s%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./serena-williams-bikini-photos-her-best-swimsuit-pictures.html><span>←</span><span>Serena Williams Beach Style Is a Grand Slam!
