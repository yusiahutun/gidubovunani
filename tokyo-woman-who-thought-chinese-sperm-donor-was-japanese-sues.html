So the sticking point in the debate now revolves around how much information the child has the right to access, and whether that should be enough for him or her to identify their father,” Odawara said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It has already taken a long time and I do not think the organisation that oversees this sector of health care is close to finding a solution.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yet another “grey zone” in the commercial supply of donor sperm is the unregulated operation of a number of foreign companies in Japan. Several hundred Japanese women are understood to have bought sperm from Cryos International, a Denmark-based sperm bank that’s the world’s largest.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The firm began offering its services in Japan in 2019, with clients including single women with no plans to get married, couples where one partner is not able to have a child, and people from sexual minority groups.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2022/01/17/clean_0.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">02:16</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Japanese woman files US$2.9 million lawsuit against sperm donor who lied about identity</p><p>Japanese woman files US$2.9 million lawsuit against sperm donor who lied about identity</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yoko Tsukamoto, a professor at the Health Sciences University of Hokkaido, said social attitudes in Japan needed to evolve before sperm donation could become as accepted as in other countries.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Right now, there are effectively no regulations covering sperm donations, and that’s why some women are having to go online to search for a donor. That’s dangerous in many ways, and that’s what we see in this legal case,” she said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It also spills over into the issue of surrogate mothers, sought after by women unable to produce eggs, but that then leads to the problem of lineage – which is very important to Japanese people,” Tsukamoto said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A couple that raises a child born from a surrogate mother cannot register the baby as their own, which has given rise to an underground surrogacy trade, she said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Technology to assist in having children has advanced so much in recent years, but Japanese laws and regulations have not kept up,” Tsukamoto said. “This is not a medical issue; it’s a problem in Japan’s strict legal definitions of families.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kxKaxymaYrKGRZL2mu8%2BlnGiZoqm2pLjEaGpqbmNrgXd706iisqddrLyurc1mrqGnXam1sMHGoatmm5ieu6a%2FxGaqqZ2ionqlu82oqWavkah6q63PmqWeq5ViwLax0g%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./liza-koshy-parents.html><span>←</span><span>Liza Koshy Parents, Age, Ethnicity, Siblings, Net Worth And More</span></a>
