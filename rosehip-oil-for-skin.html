The suns rays can not only burn us, but they can also cause our skin quality to deteriorate over time, leading to more fine lines and wrinkles. To the rescue: all-natural rosehip oil.</p><p>Rosehips are the fruits and seeds of the rose plant. Rosehip oil is extracted from those as opposed to rose oil which comes from rose petals. Rosehip oil is loaded with <a href=#>skin rejuvenating nutrients</a>, and for that reason, it’s a staple in many popular <a href=#>anti-aging beauty products</a>.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><p>Rosehip oil is a natural antiviral, antibacterial, and antifungal. On top of that, it contains linoleic acid and linolenic fatty acids which boost skins’ hydration. The fatty acids in rosehip oil help to strengthen skin cell walls, improve water retention, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>boost the absorption of antioxidants</a>. Plant compounds in rosehip oil also help <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>reduce redness and inflammation</a>.</p><p>Rosehip oil also contains <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>vitamins A, E</a>, and C. Vitamins A and C are both <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>necessary for collagen production</a> — the building-block protein of the skin. More collagen means better skin elasticity, so <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>less fine lines and wrinkles</a>! That could be why rosehip oil is found in some of your favorite <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">wrinkle-fighting beauty products</a>. Rosehip oil also contains two antioxidants called lycopene and beta-carotene, which are <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>effective fighters against hyperpigmentation and dark circles</a> around the eyes. Using rosehip oil has shown to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>increase brightness of the skin</a>.</p><p>And if that weren’t enough to convince you of this elixers’ extraordinary beauty-boosting powers, it also helps <a href=#>protect your skin from sun damage</a> because of the combination of vitamins A, C, and E, which<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#> have shown </a>to reduce UV damage.</p><p>The best part is, rosehip oil is considered a “dry” oil, or a nongreasy oil, so it’s perfect for the summer months and won’t make your skin breakout or appear oily. As always, perform a test patch with rosehip oil to check for any adverse reactions. To use rosehip oil on your skin, you can dilute it in a carrier oil like jojoba or use it on its own. For a product we love, try this one from Aria Starr (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Buy on Amazon, $14.95</a>).</p><p>Here’s to a vibrant, youthful glow!</p><p>First For Women aims to feature only the best products and services.
