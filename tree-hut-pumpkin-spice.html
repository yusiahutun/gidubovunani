As a self-proclaimed hot girl (we’re talking temperature, people), I can’t wait until the temps fall below 70 and I can finally wear leggings, socks, sweatshirts, and anything else that screams comfy-cozy. But fall isn’t just about the cute outfits you wear. When I’m in the middle of celebrating this season, I like everything I do to be fall related. That means I’m definitely decorating my apartment, lighting an apple crisp candle, and pre-ordering my Pumpkin Spice Latte on the Starbucks app. It also means every soap and scent I use has to be fall themed as well.</p><p>So when I saw that Target was already selling <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">pumpkin spice offerings from Tree Hut</a>, I knew I had to load up my cart immediately. I mean, the annoying thing about fall is how fast fall-related things sell out in stores, amirite? Grab these now to be the early bird who’s stocked up before the world goes pumpkin spice crazy.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.35><h2>Tree Hut Pumpkin Spice Latte Body Scrub</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screen-Shot-2023-08-15-at-11.31.11-AM.png><p>TikTok goes crazy over Tree Hut’s body scrubs.
