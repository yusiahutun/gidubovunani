The American mockumentary sitcom invited fans to spend time with the staff at Dunder Mifflin Paper Company for nine seasons between 2005 and 2013. Sure, it may have ended over a decade ago, but audiences have rewatched it to their heart’s content since, committing plenty of hilarious gags to memory. However, there’s one joke that fans definitely won’t be able to recall, and that’s because it was axed from the script…</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/04/GettyImages-626919872-1024x663.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-office-star-angela-kinsey-had-a-joke-she-didn-t-feel-good-about-written-out>The Office star Angela Kinsey had a joke she ‘didn’t feel good about’ written out</h2><p>Angela Martin is a fan-favorite on The Office, played by 52-year-old American actress Angela Kinsey.</p><p>If there’s anything viewers associate with the character, it’s a love for cats—after that, perhaps her strong religious beliefs. Angela, both on and off the screen, is a Christian, which is why a certain joke caused her to intervene.</p><p>Speaking with her old co-star Rainn Wilson (who plays Dwight) on the Soul Boom podcast, Angela <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">explained</a> she was raised to nurture a “very warm, meaningful relationship” with God and faith. With that in mind, some of the <a href=#>celebrity</a>‘s dialogue in the show didn’t reflect her actual beliefs.</p><p>“There were one or two times in which there would be a joke written for her that I thought was just really stereotypical, maybe one note,” she recalled. “I like to think of her as a full, well-rounded person.”</p><p>Casting her mind back to season 3 episode 1, titled Gay Witch Hunt, she shared her thoughts on the show overstepping a line when addressing Oscar Martinez’s (played by Oscar Nuñez) sexuality.</p><p>“There was a particular storyline between Angela and Oscar, where Angela was being super judgey,” she began. “I never went up to [creator] Greg [Daniels] about any joke, but there was a joke at Oscar’s expense, and I went up to Greg and I was like, ‘I can’t.’ I just was like, ‘I don’t feel good about it. I don’t feel good about that. I don’t feel like that’s what Jesus represented to me.’”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-angela-stood-her-ground-arguing-the-character-has-more-depth-than-that>Angela stood her ground, arguing the character ‘has more depth than that’</h2><p>For those wondering what the joke was exactly, it involved Angela citing God as a reason for not supporting and approving Oscar’s sexuality.</p><p>After hearing her out, Greg removed the joke from the show entirely.</p><p>“But that’s the one pivotal moment I remember being like, OK, this is feeling like a stereotype and very one note,” she added. “I feel like she has more depth than that.”</p><p>Those who have seen the episode will know that so many great jokes didn’t end up on the cutting room floor, so there was surely very little reason to leave it in if Angela held strong objections.</p><p>Considering her commitment to the show, now having played the much-loved character for 188 episodes, offering some notes when it’s important wasn’t going to be overstepping a line.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlsX2h9cK3NoJylmV2gtq%2B%2FxLJkrKyfpLFutMSrZKCqn6q7pXnTqGShmaaaeqq60p6lrKGknsOmecmoop5lp6e2tcDEp2SoraRiwamxjKidn6GTmnw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-allonzo-trier-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Allonzo Trier Dating Now</span></a>
