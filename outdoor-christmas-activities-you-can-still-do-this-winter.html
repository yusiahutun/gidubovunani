We round up a few ideas below:</p><h2 data-node-id=2 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Take a tour of London's Christmas lights on foot (or bike)</h2><img alt="covent garden christmas tree" title="Covent Garden Christmas Tree switch on, London, 9th November 2020" width=5472 height=3648 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/pinpep-covent-garden-christmas-0022-jpg-41-1606134806.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Joe Pepler/PinPep</span><p>Covent Garden Christmas tree</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Find proof that Christmas has most definitely not been cancelled by taking a tour of London's Christmas lights. Take a hot flask and start at Oxford Street, where 222,000 lights pay homage to NHS keyworkers, then move down to Regent Street, which is decorated in its usual angel garlands. Stop off at Carnaby Street on your way, which is currently bathed in pink neon light from a series of lightboxes, each of which illuminates a positive word, paying tribute to the strength, courage and kindness of Londoners. From there, wander trough the cobbled streets of Soho to Covent Garden to see its huge 60ft hand-picked Christmas tree glowing with 30,000 festive lights. A further 115,000 lights sparkle across the Piazza and its adjoining streets, creating a truly warming festive scene.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Partake in A Christmas Carol-themed walking tour</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There are few stories that conjure the meaning of Christmas quite like A Christmas Carol. Join a seasoned guide, decked in Victorian attire, who will journey you through Dickensian London to see the sights and streets that inspired the famed author to create Scrooge, Bob Cratchit and Tiny Tim. Regardless of weather, you'll walk round the passages, alleys and courtyards that Dickens stomped along as he wrote the book that would change the way we celebrate Christmas.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">To book or for information visit <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.london-walking-tours.co.uk/dickens_christmas.htm data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=london-walking-tours.co.uk class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">london-walking-tours.co.uk</a></p><img alt="leadenhall market is a covered market in london, located on gracechurch street in the historic city of london the market dates back to the fourteenth century" title="Leadenhall Market" width=7246 height=4830 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/leadenhall-market-1606159370.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">David Williams</span></p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Go foliage collecting and make some natural Christmas decorations</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Head to your nearest park or woods armed with a big black sack and scissors to collect pieces of ivy, fir branches and holly to decorate your home with, or to transform into your own Christmas wreath. Spend a few hours foraging for Mother Nature's take on tinsel (nothing drapes as beautifully as ivy) and make your own garlands, to be hung over shelves, cupboards and pictures. Look out for pine cones, pine sprigs and mistletoe, all of which will add festive cheer into your home and will create a winter wonderland scent. If you feel so inclined, press ivy between a few books, wait a week and then turn them into Christmas cards to send to your loved ones.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Collecting sprigs of holly and ivy trails won't land you in any trouble, but remember not to pick flowers from any parks or communal gardens, not to uproot any wild plants and to avoid any endangered species. Dominic Price of wild plant protection charity Plantlife told the<a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2011/mar/16/rules-picking-wild-flowers data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" Guardian" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"> Guardian</a>: "It is not normally an offence to pick the 'Four Fs' – fruit, foliage, fungi or flowers – if the plants are growing wild and it is for your personal use and not for sale."</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Book an ice skating session</h2><img alt="hampton court palace" title="Hampton Court Palace" width=3902 height=2601 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hampton-court-palace-1606158843.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For many, ice skating is an essential part of the festive build-up. While many top ice skating spots are closed this year (Somerset House and Tower of London included), there are a few are still open, staggering sessions to ensure there are fewer people on the ice. <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.rmg.co.uk/see-do/we-recommend/attractions/queens-house-ice-rink data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Queen's House ice rink" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The Queen's House ice rink</a> in Greenwich will be bigger than ever, meaning more space for everyone, while <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://hamptoncourtpalaceicerink.co.uk/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Hampton Court Palace" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Hampton Court Palace</a> offers another regal solution in the gardens of Henry VIII’s historic home, where capacity has been reduced by a third.

The majority of food banks offer a delivery-only service to the hungry now, meaning there is a greater demand for delivery drivers. The Trussell Trust, which operates a huge network of food banks across the UK, hosts large-scale Christmas events every year, at which struggling members of society, from families to the elderly, collect festive food parcels so that they too can eat on Christmas Day. An increased number of volunteers and drivers are needed at this time, so if you can spare any time at all visit <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.trusselltrust.org/coronavirus-food-banks/get-involved/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=trusselltrust.org class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">trusselltrust.org</a>.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Join a social distanced carol service outside Southwark Cathedral</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The pandemic may have thwarted Southwark Cathedral's annual Christmas market, but no global virus could stop its <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://cathedral.southwark.anglican.org/whats-on/christmas-in-the-churchyard/?d=637427664000000000" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="free outdoor Christmas carol event" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">free outdoor Christmas carol event</a>. Members of the Cathedral Merbecke choir, as well as other musicians and singers, will perform traditional festive carols between 12pm and 4pm on Saturday 5 December, ready for onlookers to enjoy. Festive food and drink will also be available to make the experience that bit merrier.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As a tribute to all those who can't be with their loved ones this festive season, Southwark Cathedral invites you to write a message to any absent relations or friends on a decoration, which will be placed on the Christmas Remembrance tree located in the churchyard.</p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Watch a Christmas film at a drive-in cinema</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Summer gave rise to drive-in cinemas at which film fans would pull up in their car to watch a classic movie.

It might be freezing outside, but there is nothing more warming than sitting alongside your household with hot toddies and blankets while watching a fire crackle and splutter. Roast marshmallows or bring out warm mince pies for added festive cheer.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Like this article? <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://hearst.emsecure.net/optiext/optiextension.dll?ID=NcWDlPSSi3ArMtOF9jaHRFlg028yqv%2BS7JDU1yR%2BJcJf8Mnc86RUtj3qXHgtGJM%2BzsVdmM%2BoAI60NE" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sign up to our new newsletter" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Sign up to our new newsletter</u></a> to get more articles like this delivered straight to your inbox.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://hearst.emsecure.net/optiext/optiextension.dll?ID=NcWDlPSSi3ArMtOF9jaHRFlg028yqv%2BS7JDU1yR%2BJcJf8Mnc86RUtj3qXHgtGJM%2BzsVdmM%2BoAI60NE" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="SIGN UP" rel=nofollow data-href="https://hearst.emsecure.net/optiext/optiextension.dll?ID=NcWDlPSSi3ArMtOF9jaHRFlg028yqv%2BS7JDU1yR%2BJcJf8Mnc86RUtj3qXHgtGJM%2BzsVdmM%2BoAI60NE" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink class="body-btn-link css-lihu0l emevuu60">SIGN UP</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwr9Slq66qlWSudICWbm1sb2lkvLbAw6imq2WTnb%2Bqv9OmmKxlkZjBqsLIraCeq12uvLZ5wpqlZquknrmtecOoZK2gmah6uLXNrZyrZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./houston-uluvpunani.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Houston Uluvpunani dating?
