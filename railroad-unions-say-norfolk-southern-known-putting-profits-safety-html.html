largest, had damage to 201 hazmat cars in 2012, compared to 157 in 2022</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>One of the factors the NTSB will be investigating is why the alarms didn't alert the train crew earlier that there was a problem.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Along the stretch of track where the East Palestine derailment happened, Norfolk Southern has installed hot bearing detectors, or HBDs, which showed a spike in the temperature of the bearing which is suspected as the cause of the crash.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>NS 32N passed through three HBD systems before derailing: the first showed the bearing on the 23rd car was 38f above ambient temperature.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The second showed it was 103f above ambient temperature and the final one was 253f, at which point the crew got an alarm and stopped the train but it was too late to stop the carriages coming off the rails.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>While the NTSB initial report did not mention any faulty HBDs, NTSB chair Jennifer Homendy has said that if there were another HBD before East Palestine the derailment 'may not have occurred'.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She has called the accident '100 percent preventable'.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Moreover, the <a style=font-weight:700 class=class rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</a> has reported that footage from a CCTV camera showed one of the carriages on the train that crashed was on fire 20 miles before the derailment, raising questions about whether an HBD wasn't working.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Train workers union the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen said that specialized signalmen called 'electronic leaders' were used to maintain the HBDs in the Eastern Region North Division B, which covers Ohio.</p><img id=i-2f463063b10fca66

meaning that fewer experienced signal maintainers would have to service the HBDs, they claim.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But they have inadequate training and do not have time for measures like cleaning, according to Chris Hand, the union's director of research.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Another factor which may have contributed to the crash was the weight distribution of the train – in the case of the East Palestine crash, 40 percent of the weight was grouped in the rear third, said Elder..</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'The weight is put at the back because it is quicker and easier to load the train up and saves the train company money.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'NS 32N was made up of numerous trains together. If you can tack it onto the back end of something that's much quicker than if you have to pull the old cars off and put them back.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'It's a momentum thing – imagine putting a golf ball in a sock.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'If you swing it around the weight of the golf ball at the back will make it powerfully go forward when you stop your hand.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'If you're going to do a much heavier train the best way is to put the weight towards the front'.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In East Palestine, the rail carriages 'cascaded' over one another because they had the momentum from behind pushing them, Elder said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But a spokesperson for the company said the company is careful to distribute weight. 'We employ several safety measures to ensure our trains are balance and operating effectively,' she said.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Norfolk Southern's decision to fire 3,500 staff during
