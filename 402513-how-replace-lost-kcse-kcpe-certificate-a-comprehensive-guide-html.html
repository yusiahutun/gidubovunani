This trend has prompted KNEC to stop issuance of these papers.</p><p class=align-left>In a statement issued to the press in April 2017, the body's representative Mr. Mohamud Ibrahim announced that the body was encountering some challenges and would stop replacing certificates.</p><p class=align-left>The move left many citizens stranded, but all hope is not lost. KNEC is now facilitating provision for confirming certificates at a Ksh. 2,320 charge. Applicants should note that this service is available only at the New Mitihani House in South C.</p><h2>How to get KCSE certificate online</h2><p class=align-left>With tens of thousands candidates sitting for their <a href=#>KCSE</a> this year, information on accessing their certificate is much needed. Gone are the days when learners had to rise in the wake of dawn to make long trips to their alma mater to collect their KCPE/KCSE certificate.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e94f9658b8b78768.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Passport processing stages in Kenya and how long it takes</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Fortunately, the modern era has brought about IT developments, and the education sector has since established an automated service portal. Below is a standard guide to download KCPE certificate:</p><li>Open any browser and ensure you have a stable internet connection.</li><li>Go to the KNEC website.</li><li>Click the 'Results' tab.</li><li>Enter your index number and results will pop up on your screen</li><p class=align-left>Students may check their results virtually and even print a copy. It should be noted that this service is only applicable for KCPE. Secondary school certification on the other hand must be collected physically from Mitihani House.</p><p class=align-left>A Form 4 or Class 8 certification is proof of education and is a recognized document worldwide whenever applying for local and international schools and jobs. In that regard, losing it may cause sleepless nights to the affected student thus resorting to help.</p><p class=align-left>With this in mind, the ministry of education continually encounters numerous challenges from fake to forged documentation and is on the forefront to safeguard its credibility. These reforms have had a negative implication to genuine students with a majority frustrated about the costs, and time-consuming process.
