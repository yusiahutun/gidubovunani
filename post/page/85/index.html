<a href=../../../abaca-resort-cebu.html></a>
What is it? A new boutique resort in a little corner of Cebu's Mactan Island. What's it like? Forget the massive, sprawling chain resorts Cebu is known for - this place feels like a private hideaway. With only six suites and three villas, it's easy to feel like a privileged guest. Abaca is all about seclusion and luxury. The resort is set on a gentle hillside with access to the ocean, a pool surrounded by cabanas, an innovative restaurant with sea views and luxurious suites and villas.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Coquette Makeup Is the New Beauty Trend to Try</h2><time>May 10, 2024</time>

Let's face the truth: It's becoming impossible to avoid the Barbiefication of all things, especially when it comes to beauty trends. As we count down the days to Great Gerwig's highly anticipated film, Barbie, it's becoming increasingly clear that Barbiecore is here to stay. And in terms of makeup, that means thinking pink. And all pinks are welcome, if the newest trend —&nbsp;coquette makeup —&nbsp;is any indication. Inspired by a softer, more ethereal feel, think of coquette makeup as Barbiecore's more romantic sister; it goes heavy on the blush and big on dewy, radiant skin.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>How many kids does Gwen Stefani have?

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex surprised the world when they announced they would be leaving the royal family back in 2020. Although they received some money from Harry's father, the then Prince Charles, the couple were expected to forge their own path.
And with their own charitable organisation, Netflix deals and now a lifestyle brand from Meghan, the pair have certainly been doing so. Meghan has been more at the forefront, with the royal mum-of-two fronting an award-winning podcast and launching her aforementioned lifestyle brand, which will sell all manner of items from shower gels to yoga mats and even jams and jellies.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Rashida Jones Tells Female Celebrities to 'Stop Acting Like Whores'</h2><time>May 10, 2024</time>

Rashida Jones‘ quirky-meets-classic aesthetic has made her a bonafide “It girl” in sartorial and acting circles. Rarely does the 37-year-old “Parks And Recreation” actress look anything but chic, and she’s certainly never been one to get mired in controversy—until now.
Jones took to Twitter this weekend to express her outrage at the recent influx of celebrities posting&nbsp;borderline pornographic&nbsp;semi-naked pictures on their social media pages.

Everyone knows dogs are considered man’s best friend, but not every dog wants to play fetch all day and cuddle on the couch all night. Some dogs would launch an all-out attack before going anywhere near a leash, as canines do not always belong to us. However, that doesn’t mean they don’t continue to inspire us, and if you’re wondering how your zodiac sign relates to wolves and wild dogs, you’ve come to the right place.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Big downtown Rock Island projects proceed quickly and slowly</h2><time>May 9, 2024</time>
