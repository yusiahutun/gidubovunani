What it has is colonial nostalgia</h2><time>Aug 8, 2024</time>
<a href=../../../uk-has-no-moral-obligation-hong-kong-what-it-has-colonial-nostalgia.html></a>
It comes as no surprise that Britain’s Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, in her article in the Post last week, waded into Hong Kong affairs and China’s internal affairs once again by dismissing the fact that Hong Kong has long ago returned to China while disregarding the success of “one country, two systems” as well as the Chinese government’s policies towards Hong Kong. I urge British politicians, including Truss, to step out of their misty-eyed colonial memories and refrain from interfering in Hong Kong affairs.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Penny Lancaster shares sweet photo of Rod Stewart's lookalike son Aiden, 12 - and fans can't believe</h2><time>Aug 8, 2024</time>

(NEXSTAR) – Amid high solar activity, many states have already had multiple chances to see the northern lights over the last two months. Another round of activity on the sun has caused a geomagnetic storm watch, bringing another chance for parts of the U.S. to see the auroras.
