Focused on Kathleen Turner’s titular protagonist as she magically returns to her youth after passing out at her high school reunion, Peggy Sue Got Married immediately avoids prioritizing scientific jargon or overwrought exposition to explain Peggy Sue’s transition into the past; instead, the time travel experience at the film’s center more closely mirrors the self-investigation that George Bailey (James Stewart) encounters in the existential fantasy near the end of It’s a Wonderful Life than the urgent expedition from the 1950s in Back to the Future.</description></item><item><title>Rumors/Spoiler Inside - Shila Carter - The Young and the Restless</title><link>/rumors-spoiler-inside-shila-carter.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>youremail@domain.com (Some Person)</author><guid>/rumors-spoiler-inside-shila-carter.html</guid><description>As I mentioned in the topic, these are just rumors, and I’m going to blur what I heard on another site.
