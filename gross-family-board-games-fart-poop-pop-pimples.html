Why else would they practice <a href=#>burping</a> on command and making fart noises with their armpits? Without the sense of shame most adults feel, they’re even free to compete who is the longest burper or furthest spitter. With kids already competing in the arena of grossness, it makes sense that game designers are churning out board games that make picking boogers, <a href=#>popping pimples</a>, smelling farts, flinging poop, and other bodily functions a family affair. These 10 gross out family board games are not for the faint of stomach.</p><h3>Pimple Pete</h3><figure class="Qf5 CMk"></figure><p>Pimple Pete is a plastic face with holes all over it. Rubber “pimples” go into the holes before gameplay begins and water goes into a rubber band-secured compartment on the back of the contraption. Kids take turns pulling the rubber pimples out of Pimple Pete’s face. Pull too hard at the wrong zit and the “Mega-Zit” on Pete’s nose will “pop,” causing the water to gush out. Despite its medical inaccuracy, Pimple Pete is the only game on this list endorsed by a real doctor, Dr. Sandra Lee, which only makes sense if you know that Dr. Lee is better known as the star of her own TV show: Dr. Pimple Popper.</p><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer>Buy Now $20</a></p><h3>Bean Boozled</h3><figure class="Qf5 CMk"></figure><p>Here we have a simple game from the Jelly Belly company that has the potential to actually gross you out (and not just offend you). Spin a wheel and you’ll land on a color. Select the color bean from the included jelly beans and eat it. You have a 50/50 shot of getting a gross flavor (e.g. barf, stinky socks) that looks identical to a delicious one (e.g. peach, Tutti-Fruitti). This is basically the game that Harry Potter plays every time he eats some Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans.</p><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer>Buy Now $5</a></p><h3>Gooey Louie</h3><figure class="Qf5 CMk"></figure><p>To play the amazingly-named Gooey Louie you pull long, green “boogers”out of his substantial schnoz. Pick the wrong one and his “brains” pop out. The makers of Gooey Louie say that it will help your kids develop motor skills, but we think it’s just as likely that they develop a fear of nose-picking based on the belief that it might lead to a spontaneous lobotomy.</p><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer>Buy Now $20</a></p><h3>Stinky Pig Game</h3><figure class="Qf5 CMk"></figure><p>The eponymous swine is a ticking fart bomb. To play, press his stomach. He’ll start singing while you roll a die and pass the pig in the direction written on the top of the die. He keeps going around the circle until he makes a farting noise. If he does it while you’re holding him you get a token. The person with the fewest tokens wins. Smells (mercifully) not included.</p><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer>Buy Now $6</a></p><h3>Poop: The Game</h3><figure class="Qf5 CMk"></figure><p>This game is Uno with a scatalogical twist. Each turn you take is a chance for you to “poop” by playing a card that has a number on it onto the “toilet.” If the sum of the cards played on a “toilet” surpasses that toilet’s “clog number,” then you lose. Some cards also ask you to do things like make a fart noise in order to inject even more pooping fun into the proceedings.</p><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer>Buy Now $10</a></p><h3>Gas Out</h3><figure class="Qf5 CMk"></figure><p>Gas Out is also based on numbered cards, but it’s more about flatulence than feces. To play, you take turns passing Guster the Gas Cloud around. Guster has a button that you’ll need to press as many times as are printed on the card you play. The more you press on Guster, the higher the chance that he makes a farting noise, which means you lose. The last player to pass Guster without him farting wins.</p><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer>Buy Now $11</a></p><h3>Doggie Doo</h3><figure class="Qf5 CMk"></figure><p>The centerpiece of Doggie Doo is a plastic dog that “eats” pellets and “poops” them out when you squeeze his leash, which you must do based upon the number you land the spinner on. A plastic shovel for picking up the poop is included, which the makers of the game claim will teach responsibility. We’re skeptical of that, but we do think kids will giggle when they squeeze the leash enough for some poop to come out.</p><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer>Buy Now $20</a></p><h3>Who Tooted?</h3><figure class="Qf5 CMk"></figure><p>A figurine of a squatting man sits at the center of this game board, four whoopee cushion-shaped buttons wired to him. Each player has a controller, and if yours lights up you have to press the button. One of ten different fart sound effects plays. Then, it’s a guessing game as everyone has to guess whose button made the sound. The challenge of this game comes with not giggling when you press the button that makes the noise, a serious task for kids who think that farting is the funniest thing in the world.</p><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer>Buy Now $25</a></p><h3>Don’t Step In It</h3><figure class="Qf5 CMk"></figure><p>Take your poop outside with Don’t Step In It. To play, you lay out a mat and spin a wheel. The number you spin corresponds to the number of pieces of “poo,” an included claylike compound, that will be placed on the mat. Blindfolded, your job is to make your way across the mat without stepping on any of the poos, which look like dog piles thanks to the handy included mold. It’s literally a game about avoiding dog poop on the sidewalk, one of life’s inconveniences for adults and a source of great humor to kids eager to cackle at their “poop”-covered friends.</p><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer>Buy Now $14</a></p><h3>What’s That Smell?</h3><figure class="Qf5 CMk"></figure><p>Like Bean Boozled, this game gives you the chance to feel some real disgust. Unlike that game, this makes you do so with your nose instead of your tongue. It’s basically a guessing game with 48 mystery whiff cards, each of which is infused with its own specific scent. Start the time and start sniffing cards, recording your guesses on a scoresheet. The winner is the one who correctly identifies the most scents, which can be good (bubble gum) or bad (bad breath). The loser has to sniff a Whiff of Shame card of the winner’s choice, and there are no good options.</p><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer>Buy Now $20</a></p><p><span>more</span> like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p63ToZyrpKljsLC5jqCcmqpfnL%2Bwv9JmnZqlmaHGbq7OmqmdZZeWuqa%2FjJ%2BYq6xdpbywvIyppqlloJ66sbjErA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fgross-family-board-games-fart-poop-pop-pimples.html&text=10%20Family%20Board%20Games%20For%20Kids%20Who%20Love%20Farts%2c%20Poop%2c%20and%20Boogers&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgross-family-board-games-fart-poop-pop-pimples.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgross-family-board-games-fart-poop-pop-pimples.html&title=10%20Family%20Board%20Games%20For%20Kids%20Who%20Love%20Farts%2c%20Poop%2c%20and%20Boogers" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fgross-family-board-games-fart-poop-pop-pimples.html&title=10%20Family%20Board%20Games%20For%20Kids%20Who%20Love%20Farts%2c%20Poop%2c%20and%20Boogers" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fgross-family-board-games-fart-poop-pop-pimples.html&title=10%20Family%20Board%20Games%20For%20Kids%20Who%20Love%20Farts%2c%20Poop%2c%20and%20Boogers" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgross-family-board-games-fart-poop-pop-pimples.html&description=10%20Family%20Board%20Games%20For%20Kids%20Who%20Love%20Farts%2c%20Poop%2c%20and%20Boogers" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./batmans-fate-post-arkham-knight-in-suicide-squad-game.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Batman's Fate Post-Arkham Knight in Suicide Squad Game">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./elsbeth-season-finale-sneak-peek-tim-gunn.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="'Elsbeth' Season Finale Sneak Peek">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
