The library did the work (since Feb. 1) without closing areas down, director Melita Tunnicliff said Friday.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2024/03/LeClib2.jpg><p>There will be new furniture put into the reading room with the fireplace, and historic displays. This July will be the library’s 20th anniversary, and they expect to unveil even more remodeling in the main library area at that time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2024/03/LeClib1.jpg><p>Built in the 1960s, originally a print shop, the building (just off U.S. 67) became a library in 2004, after a Scott County Library branch served LeClaire. A couple left in their will $500,000 to establish a new library, and matching funds were raised by the community, library director Melita Tunnicliff said Friday.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2024/03/LeClaire-ren2.png><p>The city hall across from the library was dedicated in 2005, and there is a City Center Plaza improvement project underway in between, to be completed by June. It will have grass, seating and a new stage. You can see renderings on the <a href=#>city website HERE</a>.</p><p>They plan to have concerts and outdoor movies on the plaza, Tunnicliff said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2024/03/LeClaire-ren1.png><p>On Tuesday, March 12, the library will have an open house to show off the renovations and re-launch its <a href=#>“1000 Books Before Kindergarten” program (part of a national initiative),</a> including a celebration of the remodeling in the Children’s Library Area.</p><h2 class=inline-related-stories__heading>4 MORE</h2><ul class=inline-related-stories__list><li class=inline-related-stories__story><h3 class=article-list__article-title><a href=# class=article-list__article-link data-link-type=content-link data-link-position=1 data-link-pinned=false data-link-label="Celebrate Buffalo Bill’s birthday in LeClaire">Celebrate Buffalo Bill’s birthday in LeClaire</a></h3></li><li class=inline-related-stories__story><h3 class=article-list__article-title><a href=# class=article-list__article-link data-link-type=content-link data-link-position=1 data-link-pinned=false data-link-label="LeClaire Community Library to be renovated">LeClaire Community Library to be renovated</a></h3></li><li class=inline-related-stories__story><h3 class=article-list__article-title><a href=# class=article-list__article-link data-link-type=content-link data-link-position=1 data-link-pinned=false data-link-label="Get your fill of chocolate Saturday in LeClaire">Get your fill of chocolate Saturday in LeClaire</a></h3></li><li class=inline-related-stories__story><h3 class=article-list__article-title><a href=# class=article-list__article-link data-link-type=content-link data-link-position=1 data-link-pinned=false data-link-label="New Tuscan restaurant opens in LeClaire">New Tuscan restaurant opens in LeClaire</a></h3></li></ul><p>“It’s been kind of lying dormant for a while – it’s a really great national program,” Tunnicliff said of the 1,000 Books Before Kindergarten, which will offer prizes for kids at each 100 books, starting when they have books read to them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2024/03/LeClib10.jpg><p>“We’re excited about that,” she said. “It’s a motivation to keep up with that. The kids enjoy the prizes, looking ahead to school.”</p><p>They get a folder with a list of recommended books, a reading log and coloring pages. Every local library does it their own way, Tunnicliff said. The free program encourages parents to read 1,000 books with their child before they start school. That’s just 2 or 3 books per night for a year, or one book nightly for three years.</p><p>The Friends of LeClaire Community Library funded the upgrades to the 1,000 books program, including prizes. When kids finish, they get a new backpack.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2024/03/LeClib11.jpg><p>“Our goal is to provide a simple, innovative yet fun approach to establishing strong early literacy skills.&nbsp;We help young children gain the confidence necessary to become strong readers,” says the <a href=#>1000 Books website</a>.</p><p>On March 12 from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m., the library will have a storytime with special guest reader Dennis Gerard, the mayor of LeClaire, along with talented staff readers. Clifford the Big Red Dog will be on hand to greet children and pose for pictures, and TJ Regul, balloon artist, will share his fun inflated creations.</p><p>The city of LeClaire funded the new carpet and re-painting of the space, and the Hubbell-Waterman Foundation awarded a $5,000 grant to pay for new furniture.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2024/03/LeClib4.jpg><p>A puppet show area (they got last summer) has been very popular, Tunnicliff said.</p><p>“A lot of families come here to get their kids out of the house and see other kids, and be away from screens,” she said.</p><p>LeClaire (which has six full-and part-time employees) has access to collections from other Iowa QC libraries. Its hours are Mondays-Thursdays 10 a.m. – 8 p.m., Fridays 10 to 5, Saturdays 10 to 2, and closed Sundays.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2024/03/LeClib5.jpg><p>For more information, visit the <a href=#>library website HERE</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46lppyZnGK7psPSaJqhnZOgerDB02ajnpuclrazsYyloJuqkafGbrXMqamorpWisq%2FA0mg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./best-tinted-sunscreen.html><span>←</span><span>The 15 Best Tinted Sunscreens to Add to Your Morning Routine</span></a>
