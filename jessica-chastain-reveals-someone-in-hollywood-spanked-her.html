"I won't say who, but I've been on a movie where someone very important… I had been walking down the hall and they kind of spanked me on the butt. And I did turn around and say, 'Did you just spank me?' I was really upset about it. But in their mind it was completely normal.

Honestly, in male profiles, they never talk about the age. And I feel that the media needs to treat women the same as they treat men, and not perpetuate the problem." It is widely know that Chastain was in her mid-30s when she began her acting career.</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><span data-redactor-tag=span data-verified=redactor lang=en-us>In her latest film, Miss Sloane, Jessica Chastain stars as the eponymous lead character Elizabeth Sloane, a tough Washington lobbyist who takes on the political establishment.
