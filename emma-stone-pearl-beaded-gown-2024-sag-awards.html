The La La Land star waltzed into Los Angeles’s Shrine Auditorium in an ethereal custom Louis Vuitton gown. The light gray centerpiece featured a scoop neckline with halter straps, an open-back design with a strand of fabric that extended from the halter to the waistband, and a flowy skirt that extended into a trailing train."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

The light gray centerpiece featured a scoop neckline with halter straps, an open-back design with a strand of fabric that extended from the halter to the waistband, and a flowy skirt that extended into a trailing train. The embellishments, however, were the most dreamy part of all: The dress was completely covered in iridescent purple, blue, and white beads, and small opulent pearls that formed imaginative curvy feathers. The beautiful pattern evoked the fanciful brush strokes of a van Gogh painting.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Stone accented the lovely gown simply but luxuriously, with ivory-white sandals, a white gold and diamond ring, and white drop earrings composed of two four-pointed stars, all from Louis Vuitton. She brought out the hues of her dress with her makeup, which consisted of lavender eye shadow, rosy cheeks, and a berry lip, and styled her warm ginger locks in a neat bun with small tendrils of hair coming out of the sides.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The actor-producer was nominated for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role.

Upon hearing Gladstone’s name, she looked overjoyed, grinning widely and cheering enthusiastically. The sweet moment has since gone viral online.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Even when Stone loses, she shines, which is why sparkly dresses are the perfect complement to her personality—like the Louis Vuitton gown she wore last month at the Golden Globes. That time, her frock was a sheer slip that featured tons of glittery champagne sequins, dozens of dainty pale pink and dusty-blue flower illustrations, and a high center slit, which she paired with nude heeled sandals.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/d41b366c-0c5e-4fd4-85f9-ab612540d1c4_1701099318.png alt="Headshot of Christina Perrier" title="Headshot of Christina Perrier" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Christina Perrier is a NYC-based freelance writer who covers culture and lifestyle topics.
